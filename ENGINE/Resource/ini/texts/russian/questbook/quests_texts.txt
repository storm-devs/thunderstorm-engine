#QUEST GhostShipQuest
The Ship of Souls
#TEXT 1
There's this story going 'round the taverns of a ghost ship that's been wandering the sea for ages.
#TEXT 2
It's a tale everyone seems to know. Legend has it, a vessel called the "Flying Dutchman" was touched by the devil - crew and all, doomed to sail forever. Since they can't ever know peace, the crew has taken to launching raids on passing ships and even mercilessly attacking whole cities and towns.
#TEXT  3
I hear tell it's been seen near the island. Perhaps this "miracle of nature" is worth seeing for myself... Time to raise sail! 
#TEXT  3_1
Today at sea, I encountered the Flying Dutchman.
#TEXT  4
Amongst the Red Indians of the pearl fields, I met a half-caste whom everybody calls "White Boy", though his age is far from young. His father used to be a skipper of some big vessel, and his mother was a daughter of a tribal medicine man.
#TEXT  5
The half-caste told me of the ghost ship's arrival, and the secret of its pacification. If I bring him 666 black pearls, he will pass them to his grandfather, the medicine man, who may remove the curse - making the crew of the Dutchman mortal once more.
I can only get the black pearls from the sailors when they touch shore.
#TEXT  6
So I brought him the 666 black pearls. Now I can ready myself for one last date with the Flying Dutchman. After that... well, I guess that's that. Assuming I can find it once more.
#TEXT  Survive_1
Curiously, I have survived my encounter with the specter - though my ship is not so fortune. I must say I am fascinated, as though the Dutchman was barely afloat from the start, it was I who found himself sunk.
I have lost all! What bother. Now I need to work out my whereabouts, to find a new ship, and to restore the dent in my finances before I can even get back to my search...
#TEXT  Survive_2
It has become a noble tradition; the Dutchman comes, and the Dutchman takes all. I am just just surprised that yet again I still breathe. Is someone trying to tell me something? 
#TEXT  Dead_1
Hum. It's a queer ghost that sinks like a stone. Well, the battle was fierce, and the ship spun like a dervish, yet it is done. Still... I do wonder if that is the last I shall meet this specter...
#TEXT  Dead_2
And there we have it! It is done. The tale of the ghost ship has officially passed into legend. All hands were found mortal, and all found what all mortals find. With full honor, of course.
#TEXT  help_t1
The town of @<sCity> requested my assistance against the pirates from the ghost ship.
The battle at the port already rages. I must hurry.
#TEXT  help_t2
That was some inferno! Still, now my pockets brim with black pearls.

#QUEST Rumour_GoldFleet
The Golden Fleet
#TEXT 1
I hear tell that the Spanish treasury fleet just left Portobelo port harbor, en route to Havana. Mayhap the fleet has yet to reach its destination. I wager it's worth trying to catch up.
#TEXT 2
The Spanish fleet, weighed with its precious Indian metals, has offed from Portobelo on its way for Havana. Peradventure, I might yet intercept it before the cargo finds its feet in Spain.
#TEXT 3
The Spanish golden convoy, with its cargo of gold and silver, has quit Portobelo for Havana. The fleet is well guarded. Shall I intercept it?
#TEXT 4
The Spanish golden fleet, formerly en route from Portobelo, has been helped to the seabed by its cargo of gold and silver - or rather the lighting thereof. For my part, a tricky yet profitable enterprise. 
#TEXT 5
By my hand, alas, the Spanish convoy will never reach Havana. Its cargo, however, is safe in my lower hold. There is a silver lining to any tragedy.
#TEXT 6
I have destroyed the Golden Fleet, en route from Portobelo, and taken its precious cargo for my own.

I hear that the Golden Fleet is readying to off from Portobelo. It will launch for Cuba in the front half of @<smonth>.

Reference: What's the Story With Britain?
#TEXT 1
  The last century or so has been less than rosy for Britain. About a hundred years ago, the Pope disallowed King Henry VIII from divorcing his first wife, Catherine of Aragon. Yet here is where Archbishop Cranmer enters the picture. Given that Henry was "God's chosen", thereby had supreme authority, Cranmer suggested that Henry simply issue himself a divorce. So, under Parliament's Act of Supremacy, 1534 Henry VII declared himself head of church, untying The Church of England from its Roman supervision. Yet for a man like Henry, one divorce was hardly enough; in all, he took six wives, two of whom - Ann Boleyn and her cousin Catherine Howard - he sent to the executioner's block, without a twinge of regret. Since then, there has been no peace in Britain. Though Mary Tudor made to repair ties with Rome, John Calvin changed the rules of the game - and England became Protestant.
  The civil war between Charles I and Oliver Cromwell was finished with execution of the British King. The Independent Republic (1649-1660) did not bring peace to England, for the period of ten years all English citizens had become fed up with puritan power in the Old World and in spring of 1660 they had awarded the English Crown back to Charles II Stuart, the son of executed Charles I.
  Indeed, it is impossible to pass the state's destiny to the religious fanatics! Was it so necessary to shed streams of blood, to strip the King of his power and behead him, just to return the Crown to his son ten years after?
  The recent war between England and Spain, 1655, has weakened both states, but Spain was more weak - it had lost Jamaica, even. Thus, today there is peace between Spain and Britain and the letters of marque issued by British crown were annulled. But it is all rubbish, - as the Spaniards were robbed before, the same way they were robbed today, - they had to much innocent blood on their hands.
  Beginning from 1664 here the power belongs to The Governor of Jamaica Sir Thomas Modyford. Prior to his arrival to Port-Royal he had got clear instructions from Charles II to stop piracy and to maintain good trade relations with Spain. But he was not going to obey the King's order although pretended to act this way.
  Before Sir Thomas Modyford was The Governor of Barbados. When Cromwell came to power Barbados, thanks to the Modyford's actions Barbados did not recognized the British power. It was, a sort of, seeking for independence. But Cromwell was not that Oliver who could let this kind of behavior to pass: he had sent a fleet to pacify him. Of course Modyford resisted, but soon he had arrived to an agreement with puritans and has brought Barbados back to the metropolis. And after coronation of Charles II for the British throne, Sir Thomas Modyford was appointed as The Governor of Jamaica. There were rumors it was done with the help of his influential kinsmen placed close to Charles.
  So, Sir Thomas Modyford, The Governor of Jamaica was a great deal fond of the "yellow devil". The leader of buccaneers, a Dutchman from Curacao Edward Mansfield was his fair-headed boy, but Henry Morgan was not deprived of his due share of attention. Who would refuse to accept piles Spanish gold which was brought by Henry after every crusade against Spanish settlements?.

#QUEST Tutorial_Fra
Reference: What's the Story With France?
#TEXT 1
  On March 10, 1661 Cardinal Mazarin died and complete power was assumed by young King Louis XIV. In a very short period of time Lois sets up the order in the state and he was interested in every aspect. He is a ruler who wants "to know how and to in every aspect": the King seeks an advice from his ministers to get more information about state business, The Chairman of the Parliament to obtain knowledge how to rule, judges, not to miss a single detail, and ladies not fall behind in arts of gallantry. By all means France was lucky to have such a Monarch.
  All the more, he is not just The King, he is "The Sun King" surrounded with extremely exquisite adoration if compared with other European Monarchs. As it was stated by the King himself: - ":as the heavenly body emits its warmth and light on to the Earth and so everything owes one's life to it, the same way The Sun King warms up the French people with his divine shine".
  A free corsair's stomach turns out to stand such debasement, but it is necessary to accept that almost four years of reforms accomplished by Lois XIV were very fruitful for France in general and first of all in the filed of economics.
  In 1664 the Finance Controller General Jean-Baptiste Colbert, who exercised The King's unlimited trust, had presented his famous reforms schedule for the King's consideration. First of all Colbert had concentrated his efforts to reduce the uncanny deficit of the state budget. He had even published the budget balance of France for the forthcoming year in the press and he has never been forgiven by aristocracy for that. Colbert, being a bureaucrat himself, was very well aware that if there is a shortage of money in the country it means that it was stolen by the bureaucrats.
  Among multiple maestro of jurisprudence Colbert had chosen 23 police commissars of police, legislation and finance. The Commissars awarded with military functions would facilitate the process of formation of the regular royal army and navy. Gradually the influence and authority of the governors of provinces was reduced.
  It was all fine in respect of the French Navy power, Jean-Baptiste Colbert had taken care about it, too. In the closest future a 1-st class three-deck battleship with scary fire power should be launched which, naturally, should be named as "The Sun King".
  In general in the Caribbean basin, France is pretty discreet, there is a lot business in Europe. Here the primary mission for Lois XIV is to ensure safety of the French settlements and trade traffic, and, definitely, to oppose the Spaniards in the field of the military might development and Dutch in trade. Those aims were easily achievable not by investing, but just the opposite: to get benefits it was necessary to support filibusters alone.
  The island of Tortuga is located at an important strategic point for the Spaniards, in particular. The fight for this island had being continued for several decades, Tortuga was captured either by French or by Spaniards. In 1654 the Spaniards had captured the island again but by 1659 the Brotherhood of the Coast fought it back being commanded by Jérémie Deschamps, seigneur du Rausset, who made the population to swear fealty for himself in person. In 1662 on a temporary basis he conferred the power upon his nephew Frédérick Deschamps de la Place and gone to Europe to trade Tortuga. After spending two years in the Bastille for such an attempt he had succeeded to trade Tortuga to the French West-Indian Company for a ridiculous price equal to fifteen thousand French livres.
  In 1664 Lois XIV had formally passed over the island of Western Hispaniola (another name for Tortuga) to the French West Indian Company and appointed Bertrand d'Ogeron, ex-filibuster, as the Governor of the new territory. Under the previous Tortuga governors the Brotherhood of the Coast had no complaints, either, but now it had became a paradise for the filibusters. Governor d'Ogeron had issued an instruction to bring women from Europe to his island! Indeed it was a paradise for a filibuster!.

  After the last great Spanish monarch Philip IV was dead the country entered the period of an extended regency. New King Charles II of Habsburg, four years old was so weak and suffered from so many diseases, that it was even too difficult to imagine why he was still alive. And there is nothing too strange in it: his father Philip IV was already considerably old when he had married Mariana of Austria and, as the rumors claimed, suffered from "various diseases". Thus, Mariana had become a protector of her son. How dangerous it could become was demonstrated by the recent events in France - La Fronde against Mazarin, in 1650. That is why Philip IV was engaged in preparation of the regency beforehand; to assist the Queen he had formed up a thoroughly selected governing Junta made of representatives of the political, clerical and public power.
  Despite the presence of this Junta, Maryanna, who could not face all duties, returned back to the institute of favorites to ensure the world power with regency support. Selection was made in favor of the Austrian confessor, Father-Jesuit Johann Eberhard Neidhardt. Despite the warnings the Queen, initially, conferred a nominal power appointing him to the post of the Spain Great Inquisitor because of which he automatically became a member of the governing Junta. His foreign origin and political propaganda caused a great deal of disaffection in his respect from the side of the government and population wide circles, which was enhanced by the fact that Marianne and Neidhardt badly cold-shouldered an experienced and competent half brother of Charles II, Don Juan José. Don Juan is the most interesting person of Spain. He was the sponsor of scientists such as Caramuel y Lobkowitz and Juanini; also, he was the owner of a huge library; he was the founder of the Spanish reformist science. Along with it, as a brave general and many times tried Governor he took a decisive part when suppressing Naples and Barcelona uprisings. On the other hand, his command in Flanders and Portugal between 1656 and 1663 was a great deal less successful.
  Poor Spain is really may be pitied which at the moment of its weakness is subject to offenses from all sides. But there was a cause why everybody hated Spaniards.
  Buccaneers - ordinary cattle-farmers peacefully lived on Puerto-Rico and other adjacent islands; by and large they were of French origin and did not offend any one. Then, all of a sudden, the Spaniards not paying attention to the fact that the buccaneers occupation was beneficial for them, too, decided to push them out from San-Domingo and to eliminate them completely if possible.
  The initial stage of execution of this brutal and fatal for the Spaniards mission was very easy. Following the same successfully used methodology against American savages, all of a sudden they had launched an attack upon dissipated, suspected nothing and innocent buccaneers, killing them partially and enslaving the rest of them. Beginning from this moment the hunters became more careful: they moved as small units being ready for resistance and if despite this fact they were attacked, they resisted so desperately that almost in all cases they defeated the Spaniards despite their numerical superiority of the latter and forcing them to run for their lives.
  Then the Spaniards had changed the methodology of the war conduct. Private chase of the buccaneers which lead to the death of many Spaniards has been stopped and, instead, the Spaniard began to launch their attacks upon the buccaneers in their settlements, killing musters and servants not having mercy for the dogs, even. This brutality had driven the buccaneers mad. They had united and launched an offensive war, too, not sparing a single enemy. This kind of actions was pretty effective. It looked that Spaniards stopped all their hostile activities and buccaneers began to flatter themselves that after long last they would be left alone. But their enemies just were waiting for reinforcements: as soon as they had arrived from other Spanish colonies the war has been launched again. But buccaneers had gained some reinforcements, too: the French from Tortuga and other islands,adventurers and loot searchers united with them. The enemies were constantly engaged in combat and blood was shed every where on the whole island. Even now many San Domingo stows still preserved definition of "the killing fields". It all took place between 1660 and 1665.
  There were no greater bloodthirsty devils than Spaniard and Portuguese. Only from 1535 up to 1660 from America as much precious metals were brought to Spain, as probably, the half of their volume was not provided at the mines of the Old World all together for the entire time of their existence. Half of entire aboriginal population of the New World as per the most moderate estimations, either five of six million Red Indians - had been perished in the course of the one and a half century of the Spanish rule, and their major part - was killed in the mines of Mexico and Peru.
  There was a filibuster in the Brotherhood of the Coast, his name was Monbar the Blighter. He had never taken a prize from the captured ships. The armed Spaniards, gold, goods etc. all were sent over the board, and his crew is composed by the Red Indians he had liberated from the Spanish slavery.

  Mercilessly plundering its overseas colonies, Spain had established a most severe monopoly for the trade with the New World. Beginning from the sixteenth century Seville became the only Spanish port entitled to maintain trade relations with all overseas territories. It was the place were the plundered wealth of the American continent kept arriving from the port of Veracruz of Mexico and, at the beginning, via Nombre de Dios and later via Portobelo on the Atlantic coast of Panama Neck.
  Beginning from 1537, not a single Spanish trade ship had crossed Atlantic Ocean alone - this severest rule was dictated by the interests of the Monopoly. And, besides, from the very beginning of the sixteenth century an access to the water territories of the Spanish overseas domains was closed for all ships of the other countries. Initially this system was faultless - Spain and Portugal much before other European states paved their roads to India and the New World. In 1493 Pope Alexander VI divided the whole sub-astral universe between these neighbors, and one year later they concluded an agreement on demarcation of their future conquests, so, the Spanish half contained entire America except Brazil and the Portuguese one - Brazil, Africa and Asia.
  But the judgment day had come: blood and gold of Spaniards in exchange for the blood of millions of Red Indians, tens of thousands of French buccaneers and English settlers.

  The extremely painful Spanish domination in the country is existing beginning from 1556. The cause for the Spanish attack upon Holland was constituted by the "necessity" to preserve a "pure" catholic faith which led to the completely opposite results. During the period of the spiritual yoke and political oppression a new religious teaching Calvinism got widely spread which had placed itself in opposition against the religious system of Catholicism. Under the religious protest the population of Netherlands had raised an iconoclastic upraising in the course of which all icons, statues of saints and other items of the religious cults have been destroyed. The punitive armed forces, sent by Spain had launched a cruelest terror. All people war defined as a 80-years long liberation war was launched (1566 - 1648.)
  Liberation struggle was headed by William of Orange. Struggle against Spanish enslavers had facilitated the national self-conscious growth. In the course of the period of the general revolutionary struggle the Dutchmen formed up a nation with a single language.
  In 1581 the Northern Provinces declared their independence forming up The Republic of United Provinces featured with the Calvinist religious faith. The civil war was declared and Spanish Monarch Philip II officially recognizes William of Orange "as the enemy of the human race" and sets up a price for his head. Willem was killed by a catholic. The war was still on but it did not obscure a successful formation of a new state. In 1648 Philippe VI has recognized independence of the Republic of the United Provinces which later became one of the mightiest European powers of the XVII century.
In 1650 Stadtholder of Holland William II of Orange had died and in the same year, several months after his death his new heir William III of Orange was born.
  Johan de Witt became an actual ruler of the Republic of the United Provinces since 1650 and beginning from 1653 The Grand Pensionary as a henchman of the Dutch merchant oligarchy. He made the Princes of Orange to refuse to rule the country and abolished the Stadtholder position - as a head of the executive power in Netherlands.
  It sounds strange, but after gaining independence, Holland demonstrated an outstanding economic growth for the entire world. Now, there are more ships in the trade fleet of the country than in Britain and France all together! But the Dutchmen cannot account for more than a trade fleet since there is no possibility to build big ships because their bays are too shallow and modern military ships are featured with great full load weight.
  Trade is the strength and weakness of Dutchmen. They are rich but defenseless. The British are extremely unhappy with the Dutch trade might, not one Anglo - Dutch trade war took place already and there would be the others. And Spain which still retained part of Dutch territories is showing its teeth as a wounded beast.
  It is just impossible to envy the Dutch. They are balancing on a knife blade bit but it cannot last for long.

#QUEST Tutorial_Fight_Info
Help: Combat System
#TEXT 1
COMBAT SYSTEM
*
Being extremely skillful with your blade and pistol will allow you to stay alive after any scrape. The combat system offers you a selection of three types of attacking strikes; two types of parrying; one block; one circular strike, for defense and attack; the ability to shoot from a pistol; and dashing back or to the sides.
* 
HIT POINTS
A character's hit points show the amount of damage he might take. The hit points grow with each new level, yet they can also be increased with additional abilities. 
During a fight, your hit points are illustrated by a red strip in the top-right corner, to the left of the character's portrait. You can restore hit points during a fight by using elixirs, whether by going to the menu with Enter/Use or with a hot key.
*
HEALTH
Health is an indicator of the general physical condition of your hero. When his health worsens, the character's abilities in the game also degrade. A character's health worsens if he sustains many wounds, and is restored if he avoids hand-to-hand combat for a long while. If it falls below excellent, the character begins to suffer from diminished stats, and those in turn diminish his abilities. Health does return by itself, albeit slowly; the process is fastest when a character does nothing (i.e., sleeps in a tavern), and is twice as slow during sea voyage. The ability "Excellent Health" doubles a character's health recovery rate. A golden background to the health indicator signals that health has been restored to its maximum. However, that maximum itself can be decreased by serious wounds (i.e, scars and severe injuries which, even after full restoration, have an effect in a fight). Priests, in churches, can restore a character's maximum health - though not often, not by much, and not cheaply. Sometimes you may need to visit two or three priests for "good golden" health to become "good white" - and still after that, you need to wait for the health itself to return to "excellent golden".
*
ENERGY
A person cannot fight non-stop, and eventually will be overcome by weariness. A character's amount of energy depends on his "Reaction"; the higher the value, the more the character can do. Each strike requires a certain amount of energy, so you need to be careful about how much energy you spend in a fight. A character's energy level is illustrated by a blue strip to the right of the character's portrait. If you have insufficient energy, you cannot attack. Energy is gradually restored during battle, so if you see that you have very little left, and it's not enough for an attack, try blocking or parrying for a while, until you gained a second wind. Additional abilities will allow you to expend less energy in attacking, and to more quickly regain your strength. 
* 
ENEMY HIT POINTS AND ENERGY
During fights you will see hit point and energy indicators over the heads of your enemies. When you or your allies strike a blow, a number will be shown over the enemy's head, indicating the damage dealt. 
*** 
STRIKE TYPES
Slashing - A cutting blow with a swing; deals average damage, requires little energy.
*
Piercing - A fast blow, that deals little damage. Requires more energy than the slashing strike, yet its swiftness allows for interrupting the opponent's swing. 
*
A Crushing strike requires a lot of energy and a wide swing - and it is very slow - yet it deals a lot of damage, and penetrates any guard.
*
A Circular strike requires an average amount of energy and deals some small damage to all characters standing around you. A character hit by a circular strike slightly sways backwards, giving your character some room for maneuver and a respite for a counterattack.
*
Parrying allows you to parry a strike, forcing the opponent's blade to the side; does not require 
energy; guards against crushing strikes. A successful parry will make the opponents lose their rhythm and expend a bunch of their energy.
*
A Deceptive strike (feint) looks exactly like a crushing strike. If you feint, and the opponent attempts any strike, your character will intercept his blade and counterstrike. Feinting does not require any energy in its own right, and a successful feint, that deals damage, only expends very little. A feint also allows you to intercept a crushing strike.
*
A block allows you to withstand any strike except a crushing one. It uses no energy. You can block at any time, including in the middle of an attack that you realize will be unsuccessful. A block can sometimes be penetrated with common strikes, if the opponent has corresponding abilities.
*
A shot from a pistol deals some damage to the enemy and forces him 
to take a step back. There are different types of pistols, each with one, two, or four rounds, and you need bullets to shoot; reloading pistols during a fight depends on the game settings, and is performed only with your blade sheathed or not at all.
*
Dashing lets you to jump away from your opponent, either back or to the side, letting you escape a hit or the battle altogether.
*
KEY MAPPING FOR BATTLE
To simplify controls, the game uses a "strike mode" hotkey, which, when held, activates a button's secondary mode. By default, the piercing and circular strikes are assigned to the same button - the left mouse button. Crushing and feint are on the middle button; slashing and parry, the right button. Blocking, shooting, and dashing are all assigned separate keys.

Well, I never... Modyford has used me to lure Williams to Port Royal, so as to confiscate his cargo! I must resolve the problem; off to Modyford's residence!
#TEXT  5
It seems that somewhere in Europe, Charles II has arrived at an agreement with the Spaniards; thus we are to carry out some delusion of friendship with these bloody devils! I don't even know what I shall tell Williams.
#TEXT  6
Morris Williams owes one hundred forty thousand to his creditors! These are his problems, however; I have no need for the debts of others. We bid each other heath, and went each our own way.
#TEXT  7
I gave one hundred forty thousand to Morris Williams, to clear him of his debts. I felt it my duty, as a man of honor. I was, after all, I I who invited him to Port Royal. So now my conscience is clear.
#TEXT  8
I have shouldered the burden of returning the cargo to his rightful owner, Morris Williams. I must learn what ship is meant to carry the indigo from Port Royal. Looks like I shall have to run around and talk to a few people...
#TEXT  9
The port chief has told me where Williams' cargo is stowed; it's on the Santa Águeda, which left yesterday en route to San Juan. I shall have to take the pinnace, shift the cargo to my ship, and return with it to Port Royal. The Santa Águeda is a fast ship; I hope I shall catch it up. To that end, I shall have to make the chase within the hour. Time is short.
#TEXT  10
I have captured the Santa Águeda, but Williams' cargo was nowhere to be found. I have, however, discovered one hundred forty thousand in gold, in the skipper's stateroom! My guess is, the shipowners sold off the on their way to San Juan.
#TEXT  11
So holy damn. The pinnace has gone to the bottom, along with its cargo. Poor Williams; it's all over for him.
#TEXT  12
Oh dear. It seems that Williams' cargo is beyond my grasp. I had to leave with nothing. Poor Williams; it's all over for him.
#TEXT  13
After a moment of thought, I have decided not to return the stateroom balance to Williams. Technically, there is no need; it is neither indigo or mahogany, and my crew has earned these coins with its blood...
#TEXT  14
I have returned the one-hundred-forty thousand from the stateroom to Williams. Fair dues; it's all there was of his cargo. It should be enough to allow the good brigand off his debts. For my part, I shall keep mum.
#TEXT  15
Poor Williams has got himself into the Port Royal jail. Honor dictates that I free him. The first step is to speak to the warden. I gather that he directly participated in Williams' arrest.
#TEXT  16
I have to see Modyford to bid for Williams' freedom.
#TEXT  17
Go to the moneylender in Port Royal. I need to settle Williams' debt.
#TEXT  18
The moneylender is proving... uncommunicative. I shall have to ask some people about him. Perhaps there is a way to approach him, that I'm missing.
#TEXT  19
I have spoken to the local priest; he directed me to a woman named Gillian Etherberry. From what the priest said, it sounds like she's been having her own problems with the moneylender. Sounds promising.
#TEXT  20
The woman told me a strange tale of her husband's disappearance. She seems to have grounds to suspect the leech of a moneylender, in some capacity. I must find her man, dead or alive, and get to the bottom of this case.
#TEXT  21
I chanced to find Thomas Etherberry alive, and guarded him against a court of smugglers. Now the moneylender is in my grasp. I say it's time to pay him a visit.
#TEXT  22
The moneylender had written off Williams' debt. True, poor old Morris lost his cargo; still, things could have turned out far worse. My conscience is now clean.
#TEXT  23
I have taken the Santa Águeda, yet there is nothing in particular in its lower holds and no hint where Williams' cargo could go. The [oor man; it's all over for him.

#TEXT  1
Modyford has given me a new mission: to transport a grand load of ingots from La Vega. To do so, I shall need to track down an old friend - Edward Mansfield.
Another money mission from Modyford. What a surprise. I seem to be turning into his official errand boy.
#TEXT  2
Mansfield is dead. La Vega was targeted by Spanish forces. There is no gold to be found. I have to catch up the galleons on their purported way to Santiago.
#TEXT  3
Good grief, what an odd thing. La Vega has been abandoned. I have scoured the whole settlement, yet failed to find a soul. I don't know what to think. I should report this to Modyford...
#TEXT  4
I failed to find the Spanish galleons involved in the attack against La Vega. I could not make Cuba in time...
Now I need to file a full report with Modyford.
#TEXT  5
Near Santiago, I caught and boarded one of the galleons. In the skipper's stateroom, I found a letter for Pardal, the Spanish Governor-General. But as for the gold... who knows?
#TEXT  6
Near Santiago, I caught and boarded one of the galleons. As for the gold, there was no sign. And I have no clue as to the locations of the two other galleons...

We have captured Santiago. Governor-General José Sánchez Jiménez is my prisoner. Now for Jamaica!

#TEXT  2
I found the house leased by Aaron Chumaceiro. When I entered, however, I found his space occupied by several suspicious characters. I soon learned that Chumaceiro had been assaulted, and that a robbery was underway. I had no choice by to kill the thieves. I now have Chumaceiro aboard, and we are bearing for Curacao.

Yet another mission from the Dutch governor-general. This time I am to speak with Edward Mansfield, who resides in La Vega on Hispaniola. He has information pertaining to the British side of the trade war that has erupted between Britain and the Netherlands.
#TEXT  2
Edward Mansfield knows nothing of Modyford's plans. Yet he has recommended me to Henry Morgan in Port Royal. Perhaps Morgan will be of more aid? 
#TEXT  3
From Morgan's secretary, Oliver Green, I have learned that Morgan is at home on Antigua. I must make wind! 
#TEXT  4
Morgan proposed that I work for him, to no small reward. I refused.
#TEXT  5
I seem to have failed in my mission. Stuyvesant told me off, as if I were a small child. 
#TEXT  6
I have agreed to take one more, and I grant rather interesting, mission for Henry Morgan. I must go to Tortuga and learn what I may about a filibuster named Pierre le Picard.
I presume that the best order is to question local citizens under the pretense of searching for the man. I figure myself unlikely to meet Picard in person...
#TEXT  7
The tavern owner in Tortuga tells me that Pierre has rented a room in his tavern - paid a year in advance, no less. Very interesting.
#TEXT  8
The storekeeper has babbled that Picard keeps buying valuables in his shop, practically at bulk! Well, I know one thing about this Picard - he sure has money.
#TEXT  9
The shipyard owner had told me that Picard has invested great sums into new culverins. The tale is growing more and more interesting with time.
#TEXT  10
The moneylender here will take no more investments from anybody! He has already accepted so much from Pierre le Picard that now he is nursing his temples, trying to invest it all.
#TEXT  11
Picard is a regular at the brothel. Seems the lucky bugger is doing pretty well for himself.
#TEXT  12
Morgan ejected me, without a word. 
#TEXT  13
I must rescue a British officer from prison. He will tell me where Modyford means to strike.

I was too late. Fort Orange is destroyed. Its citizens are all dead. Horrible as the news it may be, Stuyvesant needs to hear about this.
#TEXT  4

All the goods are to be sold, and I am to refill the holds with seven thousand hundredweights of foodstuffs, to return to Governor-General Stuyvesant.
#TEXT  2
The buccaneer settlement was attacked by Spaniards, and Edward Mansfield is dead. Stuyvesant must hear of this.

#TEXT  2
The parcel is delivered. Yet before I set off for Curacao, d'Ogeron asked that I report back to him in two hours...
#TEXT  3
d'Ogeron has given me another parcel, in response. Now, back to Curacao - Stuyvesant will want this as soon as possible.
#TEXT  4
Damnation! It appears I am the dupe; I have no dispatch from d'Ogeron! What shall I do?
#TEXT  5
The parcel has been taken by some unknown parties, on a brig called "La Rochelle". The port chief tells me the brig left for San Juan. Looks like I'm forced to run it down, board it, and find the stolen parcel. If I fail to... I would not care to imagine the consequences.
#TEXT  6
The brig is sunk. I failed to rescue d'Ogeron's parcel. This is a disaster.

I have failed to run down the La Rochelle. d'Ogeron's parcel is forever lost. This is a disaster.
#TEXT  8
I have boarded the La Rochelle. Before he died, its skipper told me that he had released the thief - a man named Antonio de Barossa - to a Spanish military galleon, the "Isabella". So now we know this was Spain's doing...
Isabella was heading for Santa Catalina. I need catch the galleon before our chum Antonio sets foot on land...
#TEXT  9
I failed to take the Isabella. d'Ogeron's parcel is lost forever. This is a disaster.

I have run down the Isabella near Santa Catalina... and, to my misfortune, appear to have... sunk it. There goes d'Ogeron's parcel. This is a disaster.

I learned that the pirate who wants to sell the book is named Laurens de Graf. I understand that he is a regular on Tortuga. I shall look for him there.

From the barkeep on Tortuga, I learned that Laurens de Graf  left Tortuga two weeks hither on a raid against Cartagena. Looks like I know my next stop.

#TEXT  1
Now I am subordinated to the Holy Inquisition. As I am now aware of these gentlemen, I am faced with a profitable yet very dirty job.
The gist of it is, I am to go to Santiago and find a Jesuit big shot named Antonio de Souza. That's where I am heading now.
#TEXT  2
I am to go to Curacao, and demand money from each of Joao d'Ylan, Joseph Nunes da Fonseca, and Jacob Lopez da Fonseca. That's fifty thousand each, for the Pope's absolution. Preliminary absolution, anyway.
#TEXT  3
I decided to help Joao d'Ylan to find his companion, Jacob Lopez de Fonseca, all trace of whom was lost in Panama.
#TEXT  4
I could not establish contact with the moneylender Joseph, so I shall see no money there...
#TEXT  5
I have to canvas the citizenry about this Joseph fellow. Nothing like a third party to turn up a dirty secret...
#TEXT  6
A barmaid named Thanneken Clemens tells me the moneylender's son left yesterday for Fort Orange. I guess I'll take him as for a prisoner. Surely this will suffice as leverage for father dear. As it happens, the young de Fonseca is quite the the lout - so, all the more motivation. 
#TEXT  7
The pirate lugger carrying the young de Fonseca has escaped from me. Without the son, I shall have no bargain with the moneylender. So that may be a problem.

The pirate lugger has been boarded, and the young de Fonseca is in my hold. Looks like it's time for that parent-pirate conference.

The pirate lugger carrying the young de Fonseca has, well, sunk. A bit of a pity, as now I have no leverage on the blasted moneylender. Ah me.

Joseph Nunes da Fonseca has paid his fifty thousand.

I guess first off, I should go to Tortuga and learn Rock's whereabouts. We'll just proceed from there.
#TEXT  2
Rock the Brazilian has gone to raid some Spanish vessels near Maracaibo. I have to admit, that was a good choice - you can cruise near Guajira Harbor and not see a single Spanish flag. A corvette is a pretty taught ship, so any target is as good as taken. I guess I need to alter the Brazilian's plans somewhat. Today is the onset of Rock season!

High Murder in Havana
#TEXT  1
My destiny has taken a complete transformation - I have become a sort of detective. Don Juan has assigned me to investigate the strange murder of Havana commandant Don José Ramirez de Leiva. He and his servants were killed in their own house, each steeped in a pool of blood. A gory sight. The most curious thing is the total disappearance of Don José's wife. I'm at odds as to where to begin.
#TEXT  2
My investigation has born some fruit. In the room of the mysterious Ms. de Leiva, I found an unfinished letter. It appears to be a farewell note, the implication being that Doña Anna intended to run away. The note implies that she was to be carted away by some third party. Clearly she could only have arranged this with a local. I will play the part of he who came to Doña Anna with the proposal.
#TEXT  3
Thus, the barmaid brought Doña Anna a ring that she seemed to recognize. Judging from the sand kicked up by Don Juan, he knew that Doña Anna was going to run away, and was waiting for a man to help her. He pulled together with the servants and began to wait for such a figure, but it looks like he underestimated the man. The waitress said he looked like a brigand. I guess I have to meet the Governor-General, and tell him my findings.
#TEXT  4
The Governor of Havana has asked me to go to Tortuga and continue my investigation of this enigmatic crime.
#TEXT  5
I have found both Doña Anna and Don José's presumed assassin. I figure I should pay the dear couple a visit.
#TEXT  6
I have found and punished Don José's assassin. I shall not visit Doña Anna, since that is simply a physical impossibility. Besides, assuming d'Ogeron's respect for her is mutual, there is nothing to do for me there. I suppose I might punish Doña Anna herself, but I shall not be a ladykiller. The investigation is done. Now I may return to Havana.

Yet another mission from Governor-General Oregon y Gascon. Captain Ansel's joint French and British squadron is moving to capture Cumana. I am to aid the Cumana garrison in turning away this pirate fleet. 
#TEXT  2
I failed to reach Cumana in time. The pirates have accomplished their job - Cumana is stripped and desolate.
#TEXT  3
I reached Cumana in time. I engaged the ships, and sunk the lot of them. Cumana is saved. All is well. Hooray.
#TEXT  4
I reached Cumana in time, yet I was too late to save the town; the pirates had already set upon it, and their forces were too great to turn back. I was forced to withdraw...


#QUEST Spa_Line_9_FourGolgGaleons
Portobelo Escort
#TEXT  1
The governor-general of Portobelo has summoned me to a meeting.
#TEXT  2
So my mission is to escort four galleons, each loaded with gold, to an uninhabited Cayman island. There, the Spanish Navy squadron will be waiting for us. The total gold is five thousand pieces - that would be ten thousand hundredweights.
#TEXT  3
A great surprise was waiting for me, near the island!  Instead of the Spanish military squadron, a pirate squadron of five ships was cruising the area. I engaged them in battle and sank all the pirates, yet could not protect all my galleons. Only one laden galleon remains; the rest lie at the bottom of the world. I guess I have to go to Oregon y Gascon; it was he who sent me to Portobelo. I just don't understand what happened...

Steeling Maracaibo

Yet another mission. I have been urgently summoned to Maracaibo. I am posted to the Governor-General's residence, to ensure defense of the town against possible attack.
#TEXT  2
British pirates are attacking Maracaibo! I arrived just in time. I have to see the Governor immediately - we need to coordinate our plan of action.
#TEXT  3
The British squadron is destroyed.
#TEXT  4
I could do nothing against the British. I had to flee, leaving Maracaibo to find its own destiny.

Le Grand is onboard. I am heading to Martinique.
#TEXT  3
On the shore of La Marnet, a rough gang was waiting for us. I felt the crabs would better appreciate their company. 
Pierre Le Grand is delivered, and my reward is in hand. I might as well return to d'Ogeron.
#TEXT  4
On the shore of La Marnet, a rough gang was waiting for us. I felt the crabs would better appreciate their company. 
After that, I had to deal with Le Grand himself. No sense in letting such a sum of money go walking away...
#TEXT  5
On the shore of La Marnet, a rough gang was waiting for us. I felt the crabs would better appreciate their company. 
The worst thing is, Le Grand was killed... Well that's life. Or the opposite thereof. I guess I'm burdened with clearing the poor sod's pockets. I'm sure he'd want it that way.


#QUEST Fra_Line_2_DelivLetter
From d'Ogeron to Curacao
#TEXT  1
A dull messenger job - to deliver a letter, with all haste as usual, to Governor-General Stuyvesant on Curacao, and bring his response to d'Ogeron.
#TEXT  2
Here I am, a formal envoy of the French Governor-General, and I'm locked up as a gangster. There's something wrong here...
#TEXT  3
Well, I'm free now. In fact the mission is accomplished, and I may return to Tortuga. But I still say something is queer in the Netherlands. If there's dirt here, I shall dig it.
#TEXT  4
It looks like Spain is active near Curacao! At this moment, they are waiting for a galleon to arrive at Palm Beach.
I must capture this galleon, and interrogate its skipper. Only then shall I be confident enough to discount filibusters as a source of the island's ills...
#TEXT  5
The Spanish galleon is mine. From its skipper, I have learned that this very galleon was involved in piracy within Curacao waters. I must report this all to Stuyvesant.
#TEXT  6
Stuyvesant rewarded me for the sunken galleon. Now I may quietly head for Tortuga.
#TEXT  7
The tavern owner has shown me a couple of odd characters. When I made to speak to them, they rushed past me and left the town. All in all, I could learn nothing of importance.


#QUEST Fra_Line_3_TakeAnna
Shipping Doña Anna to Tortuga
#TEXT  1
Thus I became Governor-General d'Ogeron's confidant. With my help, he strives to resolve his romantic problems. Namely, I am to bring him the wife of Havana commandant Jose Ramirez de Leiva. Charming!
#TEXT  2
A waitress at a Havana tavern has agreed to pass d'Ogeron's stone ring to Doña Anna Ramirez de Leiva. I need wait a few days until she does as promised.
#TEXT  3
I have read Doña Anna's message. After midnight tonight, I shall enter de Leiva's house. The door will be open, and we shall flee quietly.
#TEXT  4
The mission is accomplished. Anna Ramirez de Leiva, now widowed, is aboard my ship. I figure the Governor-General will be pleased enough. 
#TEXT  5
I failed in my charge. Anna is not on board. I don't even know what I shall say to d'Ogeron.

#QUEST Fra_Line_4_SoleiRoyal
A Royal Escort to Guadeloupe
#TEXT  1
I am assigned to escort the ship-of-the-line Soleil Royal de Dominique. The Governor-General is afraid that Spaniards will capture this excellent ship.
I have to report to Tortuga's port chief to receive said ship.
#TEXT  2
The gorgeous Soleil Royal is now part of my squadron. Now for Dominique...
#TEXT  3
Governor-General d'Ogeron's anxiety was justified; near Dominique, I was subject to attack from a Spanish squadron. Nevertheless, I handled myself well. The Spaniards are all wet, and the Soleil Royal is still beautiful.
The Governor of Basse-Terre was to send a French squadron to Dominique. I guess now I need to learn what happened, and why he failed to do his job.
#TEXT  4
Governor-General d'Ogeron's anxiety was justified; near Dominique, I was subject to attack from a Spanish squadron. As it happens, there was no squadron from Dominique, to aid me. Although the Spaniards are all wet, so is the Soleil Royal. The mission is a failure.
#TEXT  5
Governor-General d'Ogeron's anxiety was justified; near Dominique, I was subject to attack from a Spanish squadron. As it happens, there was no squadron from Dominique, to aid me. The Spanish forces were too great, and I was forced to flee, leaving the Soleil Royal to its fate. After all, a top ship-of-the-line should be able to defend itself...
#TEXT  6
The ship is transferred, and the mission is complete. I may return to Tortuga.
#TEXT  7
I might preserve the Soleil Royal as part of my squadron...

#QUEST Fra_Line_5_KillAnnaHanters
The Doña Anna Affair
#TEXT  1
I hear that my acquaintance Doña Anna is in some trouble. I must find her, and learn her ills.
#TEXT  2
I am heading for Havana, to unmask a conspiracy against Doña Ramirez de Leiva.
#TEXT  3
I have discovered that relatives of Don José, whom I killed earlier, are starving for revenge, and most likely to hit Tortuga. I must find them and eliminate this threat to Doña Anna's life. Anyway, I don't want them coming after me. 
#TEXT  4
There is one less problem in the world. Now Doña Anna may sleep in peace, and menacing Castilian landowners are once again welcome in these parts. I guess I have ensured a noble reception in circles similar to the one I have just protected.

#QUEST Fra_Line_6_Olone
A Letter for François l'Olonnais
#TEXT  1
On Guadeloupe, I am to find a famous filibuster named Jean-David Nau, better known as the bloody François l'Olonnais, and pass along a parcel from Governor-General d'Ogeron.
#TEXT  2
The letter has been delivered. I would not call my reward particularly generous, yet the mission is accomplished and I may return to Tortuga.
#TEXT  3
I have agreed to join l'Olonnais' squadron in its venture on Cumana. Off for Cumana!
#TEXT  4
We were too late for Cumana; there was no money by the time we arrived. l'Olonnais accused me of treachery, and I had to fight him in a pirate duel.
#TEXT  5
We captured Cumana, divided our takings, and departed. A successful affair.
#TEXT  6
l'Olonnais had accused me of stealing the prize. A fight is unavoidable.
#TEXT  7
On my approach to Guadeloupe, I was attacked by a Spanish military ship. This does not seem like a coincidence.
#TEXT  8
I decided against sharing money with l'Olonnais. It is, after all, my money!


#QUEST Fra_Line_7_RockBras

It seems that rescuing Rock the Brazilian from his Havana prison is more difficult than taking the entire town! To make it worse, no one seems to know where he is being kept...
#TEXT  2
I have found Rock the Brazilian in an Inquisition cell!
#TEXT  3
I am on my ship, and Rock the Brazilian is my passenger. The mission is accomplished. Now I am off to Governor-General d'Ogeron.
#TEXT  4
After some adventures with the Inquisition, I finally reached my ship. But Rock the Brazilian is not with me. To be more precise, he is no longer with us. I did all I could... But, well. Now I must report to Governor-General d'Ogeron.


#QUEST Fra_Line_8_ThreeCorsairs
The Disposal of Marquis Bonrepaux
#TEXT  1
New secret games of the rulers! I am to immediately travel to Guadeloupe, to deliver a new mystery mission from France's chief naval officer, Marquis Bonrepaux himself!
#TEXT  2
They have tried to lock me up! It seems nothing is quite as simple as it appears...
#TEXT  3
Instead of paying his liegemen, the Sun King is arranging his affairs on their account! I must say, this is not the best mission I have undertaken. I have to visit the following pirates - Morgan of Jamaica, Jackman of Bermuda, and Morris of Trinidad and Tobago - and convince them not to take part in the war against Dutch. All right then.
#TEXT  4
Though Morgan has stripped me of a great sum of money, he agreed to refused to participate in the mess. Which... is good, I think.
#TEXT  5
Jackman will not take part in the war. At least, not personally. Hmm.
#TEXT  6
To convince Morris to keep out, I need to find the ship's log of a certain Guay, who is wandering somewhere around Port Royal.
#TEXT  7
Morris shall not work for Modyford. That, I have made perfectly certain.
#TEXT  8
Thus, after all my adventures, I have become a nobleman... Yet at the same time, it seems I will have to earn my estate myself. Well, lots of folks are seeking an in to the French aristocracy. So that's something, I guess. Still, I have to accept that I have never had such unprofitable mission in my life!

Spanish Repulsion in Port-au-Prince
#TEXT  1
I am reinforced with the ship-of-the-line Soleil Royal. Together with it, I shall have to take an active part in France's war against Spain.
My first mission will be the defense of Port-au-Prince.
One small nuance, however: while Soleil Royal is attached to my fleet, I cannot under any circumstances lose it.
#TEXT  2
Port-au-Prince's attackers are sunk; the Soleil Royal remains afloat; all is well. I have cleared my first mission with honors, and may return to Tortuga.
#TEXT  3
The Spanish squadron that attacked Port-au-Prince has been sunk, so that is all well. Yet the Soleil Royal now decorates the seafloor, and that is very poor. I am afraid I will take some punishment for that.
#TEXT  4
Damns and ribbons, there were too many Spaniards! How could they have pulled together such a mighty squadron, here in the Caribbean?
I had to flee, leaving Port-au-Prince and the gorgeous Soleil Royal for their fate. Well, that mission is sure a bust.
#TEXT  5
I could not reach Port-au-Prince in time. The town is taken by the Spanish. The mission is a failure.

I have just forgotten about everything in the world just by looking at that beautiful lady. What has happened to me? I am ready to rush to the end of the world just to gain her favor..

I have boarded and captured the Enthusiastic. Hosanna! Isabella was onboard. We have talked and now I will have to bring beautiful lady Isabella to her cousin Rosita Fernandez in Belize.

Hunting the "Blue Bird"
#TEXT  1
The owner of the @<sCity> shop, a fellow by the name of @<sName>, has asked me to find and destroy an elusive xebec known as the Blue Bird. The problem is, the captain to this peculiar ship keeps plundering the local merchant vessels, which are owned by the shopkeepers themselves. So basically, merchant profits have fallen below the waterline.
Over the course of that conversation, I hit on one very important detail about this case. Curiously, of all the merchants in the Caribbean, only one possesses the improbable luck to have never met the Blue Bird. The name of this Fortune's favorite is Pascal Vousier, a shop owner from Bermuda. His merchant colleagues think of him as a saint, since he supports everyone financially.
Though I do believe in good luck, Vousier's improbable level of fortune strikes me peculiar. I will deal with this case on the spot - that is, on Bermuda...
#TEXT  2
I tried to speak with Pascal Vousier about the Blue Bird. Monsieur Vousier suddenly became outright rude. Something's not right here; I'll need to investigate further...
#TEXT  3
The owner of a tavern on Bermuda revealed to me that the xebec is rather often seen near the island. Also he told me that the previous owner of the local shop, John Norton, has moved to Puerto Principe. I believe I should visit him...
#TEXT  4
John Norton has confirmed my suspicions concerning Pascal Vousier. John believes that the xebec belongs to Pascal, and that he is behind all of the attacks on the merchants.
If this is true, I need to understand how Pascal transports the stolen goods. As far as I know, the shipyard in the pirate settlement has an underground passage that leads directly from the bay to the city...
#TEXT  5
Poxes, it looks like my guess about the shipyard's dungeon was incorrect. To be sure, it would be easier for Pascal to simply take a tartane and tote the loot directly to port, right in plain view, than to drag stuff through a hole in the ground. So all right, we've a problem here...
Still, one thing is clear: the base where the goods are stored is somewhere on Bermuda. First, Bermuda is an outlying island, and it's one thing to send a tartane to the other end of an island, and completely another if you're sending it to another island altogether. And second, it is here that the xebec has been sighted rather frequently.
I need to look for Pascal Vousier's base on the island.
#TEXT  6
Ah, at last I have found Pascal's base. I track down a group of armed pirates, presumably from the Blue Bird, as on their shoulders they lugged crates, barrels, large bottles, and other stuff through the cave. I have no doubt that this is the latest cargo looted from the merchants.
Well, the Blue Bird is nearby. Time to to set sail and sink it, while I can! Or would it, perhaps, be better to capture it?
#TEXT  7
The cap'n of the Blue Bird is dead. The deed is done. Now I can go back to claim my reward.
#TEXT  8
I was unable to catch up with the pirate and sink him. I failed in my task.
#TEXT  9
Oh, I don't believe this! They refused to pay my fee, on the grounds of my not sinking the Blue Bird. Well of course, I'm not cretin enough to send such a fine vessel to the blue depths.
Now the merchants are afraid that I will plunder them with this ship. Well then, let's us make their fears a reality! Just you wait, you bloody prevaricators!
Now I need to know where and when the merchants own ships mean to leave ports. I need to canvas more rumors.
#TEXT  10
At last, fortune smiled on me in @<sCity>! Rumor had it, a local merchant, @<sTradeName>, was about to send out his flute after some goods. And now that flute, @<sShipName>, has just left the @<sCity_2> harbor.
I need to set sail immediately! I am counting on the assumption that the merchant's flute will not escape me in the waters of @<sIsland>.
#TEXT  11
Looks like I set off too late. There wasn't even a trace of the flute near @<sIsland>. Well, now I suppose I need to start all over again. There are more ships where that came from.
#TEXT  12
I set sail near @<sIsland>, but I couldn't meet with the flute, let alone board it. Well, back to the rumor mill. Perhaps I'll catch another break. Just have to keep asking...
#TEXT  13
In the waters of @<sIsland>, I sink a local merchant flute. This is fine; it's working. I will continue. I will make those merchants give me my money. As always, I need to collect rumors and be attentive.
#TEXT  14
It's done. I received not fifty, but two-hundred thousand for that business with the xebec. Doesn't that just warm a pirate's heart?


#QUEST SharpPearl
Find the location where the Pearl Divers ply their trade
#TEXT  1
From the brothel mistress in @<sCity>, I learn that Sharp has gone to @<sTarget>@<sAreal>.
#TEXT  2
I didn't find Sharp in @<sOldTarget>. According to rumors, he left for @<sTarget>@<sAreal>.
#TEXT  3
I was just told that Captain Sharp left port only about an hour ago. If I leave immediately, I shall catch up with him.
#TEXT  4
Unfortunately, I did not reach an agreement with Sharp. If I want to speak with him further, then I believe I will need to start looking for him in brothels again.
#TEXT  5
I have caught Sharp. That is, ahem, Captain Sharp. According to him, in @<iDay> the pearl divers will conduct their trade in @<sAreal>, in a place called @<sTarget>.
I need to be there on time.
#TEXT  6
I went to the sea, but already there was no trace of Sharp... It seems I've lost track of him. Time to hit the brothels again.
#TEXT  7
I make good off the pearl divers trade. My loot from the raid consists of @<iSmall> small and @<iBig> big pearls.
Not bad. I'll need to track down Sharp again sometime...
#TEXT  8
I didn't make good off the pearl divers. I came in time, even saw their tartanes, yet I couldn't catch a single one of them. A pity...
Anyway, life goes on. I'll need to find Sharp again later and get a new hint about the pearl divers trade from him.
#TEXT  9
The Devil! I didn't get to the place called @<sTarget> in @<iDay>. Which means I've missed my turn with the divers and their precious pearls. 
Still, I guess that's all right. I just need to find Sharp again and get a new hint about the location from him.
#TEXT  10
This time around, Sharp wanted money for his advice. I had to refuse his offer; I can do without pearls for the moment.
#TEXT  11
From a passer-by I have gleaned that at this very moment, Captain Sharp is roaming the streets somewhere in this town. I must find him before he vanishes again...
#TEXT  12
I hesitated too much, with the sea launch. Sharp has already left my line of sight. It's a pity. Well, back to the brothels.
#TEXT  13
Sharp doesn't want to speak with me right now. Not good. I'll need to go hit the brothels again, sometime, and look for him... 


#QUEST SharpPearl_SeekSpy
Find the person amongst the pearl divers who gives Sharp his... sharp information
#TEXT  1
Aha, so that's how that smart-ass Sharp knows all the secrets of the pearl divers!
One of the elders of the pearl divers settlement has tasked me to find, among his people, the one who spills to Sharp the locations of the divers tartanes in the Caribbean. My reward would be some good fighting ammunition, and I've got this rat god as an advance payment!
Not shabby at all...
#TEXT  2
The Indian by the name of @<sName>, from the pearl settlement, told me all about Emilio Garcia. Time and again, the Indians from the tribe of my red-skinned friend saw this Emilio fellow in caves of the San Juan del Norte Bay at night. He was talking to some stranger.
Perhaps I should keep visiting these bay caves until I encounter this Emilio. I sure don't have any better leads. 
#TEXT  3
My instinct tells me that this time around fortune awaits me in the Gulf. I need to thoroughly search those caves.
#TEXT  4
It's done! I learned that Emilio Garcia was indeed behind the leak about the tartanes. Now I can claim my promised reward at the divers trade location.
#TEXT  5
In the settlements of pearl divers, I received the set of fighting ammunition that was promised me.


#QUEST  Pir_Line_0_Waiting
Goodley of Puerto Principe
#TEXT  1
In the pirate settlement of Puerto Principe, I was lucky to meet the famous corsair captain Goodley. He subtly mentioned something about trust... I feel that he wanted to charge me with some important task.
When my affairs with @<sNation> are at, or near, their end, I should seek out Captain Goodley again. Then, according to the Captain, he will have more reason to trust me.
#TEXT  2
The head of the pirate settlement on Bermuda has asked me to go to Puerto Principe. There I will need to find Captain Goodley; he asked Jackman for help.


#QUEST  Pir_Line_1_JohnBolton
Morgan's Favor
#TEXT  1
I must meet John Bolton and bring him to Morgan, in Port Royal. I have been given a chance to stand out! John is waiting for me in the bay at Puerto Principe.
#TEXT  2
The passenger is aboard. As they say, yo-ho! Now, to Port Royal!
#TEXT  3
Bilious barnacles! I have failed Morgan's task! I can't believe I could get myself into a situation like this. What will Morgan say?
#TEXT  4
Morgan released me from prison. I don't quite understand what this John Bolton fellow had to say, but Morgan doesn't hold a grudge against me - and that's good!
I need to get ready for the next task, and this time I mustn't blunder. This could well be my last real shot at fame.


#QUEST Pir_Line_2_BlackLabel
The Black Mark
#TEXT  1
I am heading to Martinique. Morgan has tasked me of handing a Black Mark to Edward Law.
Now I only need to decide where to begin my search: in Fort-de-France or in Le Francois?
#TEXT  2
The owner of a tavern in Le Francois told me about the house where I might find Edward Law. After leaving the tavern, I need to turn right and go straight 'til the end. The house lined with planks will be the Edward Law's house.
#TEXT  3
I have found Law, but it appears that his issues with Morgan are already settled. I have taken the mark away, now I need to return it to Morgan.


#QUEST Pir_Line_3_KillLoy
Find and kill Edward Law
#TEXT  1
Law deceived me with the Black Mark. This Edward appears to have nerves of steel...
Well then, now I guess I need to find and kill him without any black marks. Simply find him, and spill his blood. Damn, I feel so embarrassed before Morgan...
Let's hurry back to Le Francois!
#TEXT  2
I have returned to Law's house in Le Francois, but he's not here. Well, it's not like I expected any better. By no means is Edward an idiot.
So let's start our search...
#TEXT  3
Where could he get hold of a ship? There is no shipyard here...
#TEXT  4
Law was spotted on the shipyard of Fort-de-France; he tried to buy a ship there. The needle is found, now I need to see the local moneylender...
#TEXT  5
The moneylender has confirmed that Law tried to borrow some money from him, to buy a ship. However, that's it; I learned no more than that. Back into the haystack, Law is rendered... 
#TEXT  6
Curse him! That stubborn desk rat! It seems that I've failed the task. What shall I say to Morgan now?
#TEXT  7
We head for Bermuda. Damn that Law! When will I finally catch him? Now taking bets...
#TEXT  8
That damned chief of port management in Fort-de-France has requested a whole fifteen thousand piasters for information on Law's destination. I sure don't carry that kind of money around with me. I guess I'll have to dig it up, though, and in a hurry...
#TEXT  9
That bastard Law was asking about the local shipyard, in a tavern in Bermuda.
#TEXT  10
At last, fortune has smiled on me! I feel that everything will be settled at Jackman's place.
#TEXT  11
Oh, what a damned wretch this Law is! Even here he managed to play his dirty tricks and disappear But that's nothing. Wherever he runs to, I will get him anyway! I must question the owner of the tavern a bit more. But first, I'd prefer to drop in on Jackman...
#TEXT  12
Jackman's commission will not interfere with my plans, and the double reward can't be a bad thing. Hm, whaddaya know, worms... I'm a wolf!
#TEXT  13
Back in pursuit. How many times now? I've lost count. At least I know where to go this time: to Cumana. There is a high chance that Law has gone there. Anyway, that's all the lead I've got.
#TEXT  14
It seems I have crossed Law's tracks. Rumor has it that luggers and sloops have been disappearing near Cumana, and a certain brig is thought to be to blame. That feels like Law to me; it's very much his style. He attacks the weak, just like a jackal.
Perhaps the best plan is to lure this hyena onto myself. For this I have to set sail near Cumana on a lugger or a sloop, and hang around. I'm really hoping that Law will take the bait...
#TEXT  15
I went to sea as planned, on a small vessel. Now I should search the waters of Cumana for a brig. Oh, that Law... there's no way he won't fall for this...
Whatever happens, I need to board that brig and clear some things up for myself...
#TEXT  16
I could not find Law in the waters of Cumana; the Sea Wolf has escaped me. I'm afraid this means I failed the task...
#TEXT  17
At last! The pursuit is over, the deed is done! Now all I need do is claim my reward.
#TEXT  18
Edward Law is dead, but I haven't secured the Sea Wolf for myself. So the mission is... a partial success, I suppose. Anyway, now I'm due a reward.
#TEXT  19
A truly imperial gift! Now this handsome brig belongs to me.
#TEXT  20
I received twenty thousand from Jackman for sending Law to the blue depths. Not bad!

#QUEST Pir_Line_4_Pearl
Morgan's Pearl Tip
#TEXT  1
Henry Morgan has suggested that I plunder the tartanes of pearl divers, who mean to trade for a whole month at the coast of Turks in the Northern Bay. I must deliver no fewer than 1000 small and 500 big pearls. The profit is half-and-half.
#TEXT  2
I was late. When I arrived at the Turks, there wasn't a tartane in sight. Looks like I have failed...
#TEXT  3
Having plundered a few tartanes, I racked up @<iSmall> small and @<iBig> big pearls. Now back to Morgan.
#TEXT  4
Though I arrived at the Turks in time, somehow the tartanes got away from me. I didn't overtake a single vessel. What an embarrassment... This means I return to Morgan with nothing.

#QUEST Pir_Line_5_Hunter
A Job as a Bounty Hunter
#TEXT  1
Looks like I'm a bounty hunter now. First throat to slice is some impudent sort by the name of John Avery. A simple job for the money I'm given. Last he was seen was in Willemstad, so, first I need to go there and visit the moneylender.
#TEXT  2
This job looks to be a bit tougher than I expected. I guess I'll need to snoop around the taverns; maybe I'll learn something. The moneylender in Willemstad remembers that John meant to head for the English in @<sCity> - that's on @<sIsland>.
#TEXT  3
So-ho! Things are getting interesting already. John Avery was in the tavern in @<sCity>! Now to pay a visit to the local moneylender...
#TEXT  4
The moneylender in @<sCity1> told me that Avery did some work for him in the city. The profiteer thinks that Avery would be off go to the Spaniards in @<sCity2>, @<sIsland>.
Uh-huh. The boy's a wild one, he is. Well then, let us continue our royal search...
#TEXT  5
Aha, so Avery was here five days ago; he surfaced in the tavern of @<sCity>. It seems, he had some business with the local moneylender. Now, quickly, to the bank!
#TEXT  6
Yes, this Avery is at his old tricks again. The local moneylender says he overheard him in the brothel. By what he says, Avery was going to go to the French in @<sCity>, @<sIsland>.
Well, the search goes on. I feel that I'm getting close...
#TEXT  7
Avery surfaced in the tavern of @<sCity>, to kill a sharper. Well, no big shock there...
John was here for a reason. I'd better visit the local moneylender.
#TEXT  8
The moneylender in @<sCity1> told me that Avery was here and did his usual job. Lord knows where John went from there. However, I'm betting he wouldn't go past @<sCity2>, on @<sIsland>. The logic is simple: the moneylender there was robbed recently.
#TEXT  9
He was here yesterday - I may yet weigh up with him! Quick, to Bermuda! This is all doubly rosy, as I may have some decent extra profit waiting for me there - I can claim Avery's job for myself. The moneylender promised me five thousand, if I should return him the fifty thousand that he was robbed.
#TEXT  10
John Avery is here! He went towards the Orry Bruce's house. Perhaps that's the robber the moneylender is after?
#TEXT  11
Well, there we have it. The deed is done. And now, the pleasant part - claiming the reward. I think that I'll find captain Goodley in the tavern of Port Royal. Also, mustn't forget the moneylender in @<sCity>.
#TEXT  12
I think I should drop in to see Morgan, to brag of this Avery business.
#TEXT  13
Oh my, this is the stuff of nightmares! Captain Goodley framed me; John Avery was Morgan's authorized representative!
Still, justice is restored. I finished off Goodley, right in front of the Admiral. Still, all in all, what an unpleasant experience...


#QUEST  Pir_Line_6_Jackman
Go to Jackman
#TEXT  1
Henry Morgan has asked me to go to Jackman, to tell him of the death of Captain Goodley.
#TEXT  2
Jackman was very surprised to see me in his residence. By the way, Jackman told me that I have captured his own Captain Stede Bonnet and handed him over to the Spaniards! Well, that was unexpected...
Anyway, Jackman has directed me to the Gulf of Cozumel, north of Belize. There, John Leeds has dropped anchor on the frigate Antwerp. I must talk with him.
#TEXT  3
The crew of the corvette that John Leeds sank has landed in the gulf of Cozumel. Their captain is my namesake, and according to rumors, looks a great deal like me. John Leeds has recommended that I ensure their destruction. Indeed, it seems that I have little choice in the matter.
#TEXT  4
I've destroyed my "brother" - and he really did quite resemble me. Who he was, where he was from, what he did with his life... well, I guess I'll never know now. 
#TEXT  5
Jackman has sent me back to Morgan. He must learn of my double.


#QUEST Pir_Line_7_Soukins
Finding Steve Linney
#TEXT  1
I need to catch up with the pirate Steve Linney, whom Morgan sent to La Vega to investigate the reasons for a series of strange recent events happening in the Brotherhood of the Coast.
#TEXT  2
The owner of the tavern in La Vega told me that he hasn't seen Steve Linney himself for some time now, but his friend has just left for the sea. I need to catch up with him.
#TEXT  3
I failed to overtake Steve Linney's friend at sea. Now I have no idea where I should start searching for Steve...
#TEXT  4
Morgan has informed me that Linney went missing, and his schooner, the Swallow, was said to have been for sale at the Santo Domingo shipyard. I must go to Santo Domingo and make clear for myself the situation surrounding Linney's schooner. Perhaps I could unscover his tracks along the way...
#TEXT  5
That friend of Steve Linney told me a queer story. He says that a few days ago Steve left with two strangers, direction unknown, and just vanished. Furthermore, his schooner, the Swallow, seems to be for sale at the Santo Domingo shipyard. I suppose I should go there and take a look...
#TEXT  6
I must find the frigate Leon, whose owner is the seller of the Swallow. There is some speculation that this frigate may be at sail near the coast of Espanola.
#TEXT  7
I have boarded the Leon. The captain suggested that I come over to the side of his admiral, Richard Sawkins. Naturally, I refused. I need to tell Morgan about this; it seems there's a plot to depose Henry.
#TEXT  8
Morgan has sent me to Puerto Principe. According to rumor, Sawkins is planning some action against the Spaniards. I need to learn the details of his plan, and somehow prevent it.
#TEXT  9
I got my hands on the logbook of Sawkins, in which he details his forthcoming plan against the Spaniards.
Sawkins discovered that the Spaniards are planning to transport a huge cargo of gems from Panama. For this operation, they decided against an overland delivery of the cargo, favoring a voyage across the Caribbean. A solitary battleship would go around Cape Horn, up to the fortieth meridian, then veer right and straight to Lisbon.
It's amazing that Sawkins could be privy to such a guarded secret, yet those are the facts. Richard is gathering a squadron of ships to meet this battleship and its gems near San Martin.
So, the Spanish battleship will pass on the East side of the Caribbean sea; she will appear at Trinidad and Tobago, then will head up to San Martin -- where Sawkins plans to lay in ambush. Looks like I need to intercept the ship before him.
Judging by Sawkins's records, two weeks from now a squadron of pirates will be waiting for the Spaniard at San Martin. I should set sail immediately, and intercept the Spanish ship below San Martin.
#TEXT  10
I have spent a lot of time on land. This delay may become fatal for my attempt to meet the Spanish ship.
#TEXT  11
I have sighted the Spanish ship in question! Now to board it or send to the depths - doesn't matter, so long as Sawkins doesn't lay his hands on it.
#TEXT  12
I didn't find the Spanish battleship. This mission is a failure, then; I was unable to spoil Sawkins's plans. Now I guess it's back to Morgan...
#TEXT  13
So I did ruin Sawkins's plans in the end. The huge cargo of gems will not fall into his hands. Mission accomplished. Now, off to brag to Henry...
#TEXT  14
I didn't find the Leon, and Steve's destiny remains unknown. There's nothing more I can do; I guess it's back to Morgan, then...
#TEXT  15
There be the Leon! Now, to board it and interrogate the captain!


#QUEST Pir_Line_8_Panama
Campaign to Panama
#TEXT  1
Henry Morgan has offered that I participate in a campaign to Panama. The idea is fundamentally crazy, to put it mildly. Still I will take my part in this business, as Henry really does seem to need me.
I must thoroughly prepare for the campaign, and be in Morgan's residence in twenty days, fully armed and ready.
#TEXT  2
It seems that I am too late. Henry left for Panama without me...
#TEXT  3
Morgan entrusted me with command of his combined squadron, and I failed to approach Portobelo quickly enough! What chagrin... 
#TEXT  4
Morgan has formed a squadron of five powerful battleships - and I have been entrusted with its command! I should move to Portobelo as fast as possible, and take the city straight off.
#TEXT  5
We have taken Portobelo. However, the joy of the successful attack is somewhat overshadowed. The captured governor of the city told us that the Spaniards know of our planned campaign to Panama, and are prepared for it. He said that we will all die in the jungle, on our way to Panama.
Morgan believes that it was Sawkins who secretly informed the Spaniards of the attack.
So, despite everything, we are still aimed to Panama. I am in charge of the second combined group, which needs to reach Panama through the Gulf of Darien. My group will contain Richard Sawkins, among others...
In short, I must land in the Gulf of Darien no later than two days from now, and from there carry on to Panama. On our way, during the Spanish onslaught, I need to quietly shoot Sawkins. By any means, Morgan does not want to see him storming the city walls.
#TEXT  6
I have failed an elementary task. Morgan asked me to arrive in the Gulf of Darien in two days, and there to start moving towards Panama... but I didn't do it. Sawkins has now left my squadron, and it seems that I'll miss all the action in Panama.
#TEXT  7
Sawkins didn't live to see the storming of Panama. A key issue for Morgan and me has come to a satisfactory end..
#TEXT  8
I failed to off Sawkins before approaching Panama. This was a very important detail in Morgan's plan. I'm afraid he will be rather displeased with me...
#TEXT  9
Panama is taken! We have survived the fight at the city walls; the Spanish forces are exhausted by our jungle ambushes; the city is empty.
I urgently need to take the Panama governor's residence and, should he still be seated, interrogate him.
#TEXT  10
Since Richard Sawkins is still alive, Morgan has chosen to ostracize me. Now all that I am left is to return to my ship and sail back home...
#TEXT  11
I found and interrogated the governor of Panama. It seems that the gold of Escorial is in a locked chest in the governor's office. However, the governor doesn't have the key to the chest; he said that the commandant of Panama always had it.
I must find the key to the chest, and take the gold.
#TEXT  12
I found the gold of Escorial, and handed it to Morgan for a fair split under the laws of the Brotherhood of the Coast.
Now I need to head back to the fort. According to Morgan, the commandant has hidden another portion of the gold of Escorial in a chest outside of the fort. I need to take that money as well.
#TEXT  13
Devil take it, something terrible happened! Morgan has taken all the valuables that we found here, and set sea on a Spanish galleon that stood abandoned in the port. Well, there you go!
I couldn't assemble the pirates, so I'll just have to head off alone, for my ship in the Gulf of Darien.
#TEXT  14
Henry Morgan has returned from London. I crashed Morgan's gate, hoping for a payment and my share of the Panama campaign money. This time, however, my high hopes were not to be fulfilled. It seems that the Brotherhood of the Coast has come to an end...


#QUEST ShipyardsMap
Industrial Espionage
#TEXT  1
The owner of the shipyard in @<sCity> asked that I steal the blueprints for the new @<sShip> from the shipyard in @<sTarget>.
#TEXT  2
It's done; I have the blueprints. Now I need to deliver them to the customer and claim my reward.
#TEXT  3
Curses! The shipyard owner in @<sCity> has refused to pay for his order! I was unlucky, I imagine that I didn't quite bring him what he wanted....
#TEXT  4
The shipyard owner in @<sCity> liked the blueprints I delivered. I received @<iMoney> for it. Not bad.
#TEXT  5
During the next twenty-four hours, the entrance to the shipyard in @<sCity> will be open. I must not waste this chance...


#QUEST SeekMayorsRing
Wedding Ring in a Brothel
#TEXT  1
Governor @<sName> of @<sCity> has asked me to find a wedding band that he lost in a brothel. There's no indication as to where I should search, for the honorable Governor had such a cheerful time that day that he has no recollection of his actions or whereabouts. 
I must find the ring and return it to the owner today.
#TEXT  2
Looks like our fair governor of @<sCity> gave the ring to a brothel girl by the name @<sName>! Oh, the things you do while drunk. I redeemed the ring for five thousand; now I can bring it back to the Governor.
#TEXT  3
Looks like our fair governor of @<sCity> gave the ring to a brothel girl by the name @<sName>! Oh, the things you do while drunk. Well, I have the ring; now I can bring it back to the Governor.
#TEXT  4
I failed to bring the governor of @<sCity> his ring in time. Alas. The poor fellow.
#TEXT  5
I failed to find the governor of @<sCity> his ring. Alas. The poor fellow.
#TEXT  6
The governor of @<sCity> shall be pleased to learn that his ring is found. Now, let's hurry it back to his honorable finger.
#TEXT  7
The governor of @<sCity> is reunited with his wedding band. I'm sure something horrible has just been averted.

#TEXT  2
The moneylender's stone is found. Now I can go trade it for my reward.


#QUEST Church_DestroyGhost
The Church and the Spirits of the @<sLocation> near @<sCity>
#TEXT  1
The local priest tells me that the @<sLocation> near @<sCity> is haunted by evil spirits. I must go there, summon the evil spirits, and destroy them all.
#TEXT  2
Well, the evil spirits are summoned. Now I must destroy all these skeletons and cleanse the place.
#TEXT  3
I have reported to the padre. Our business is complete.


#QUEST Church_NightGuard
Night Watch at the Church in @<sCity>
#TEXT  1
The holy father in @<sCity> has asked me to take a night watch position in the church building, for the next three nights. He suspects that someone plans to rob the parish. I must stay in the church, and not leave, from midnight to six in the morning.
#TEXT  2
I wasn't in the church at midnight, and that goes directly against the holy father's stipulation. Ergo, I failed my task.
#TEXT  3
Though I know better, I seem to have left the church during my night vigil. Ergo, I failed my task.
#TEXT  4
I held duty for all three nights, so my commission is done. Now I can go see the father with my report.
#TEXT  5
The church thieves have finally arrived! I'm afraid that a fight is inevitable...


#QUEST PortmansBook_Delivery
For the Benefit of @<sCity>: Catching Captain @<sCapName>
#TEXT  1
The chief of port in @<sCity> has given me a small task. The thing is, the captain of the @<sShipTypeName> @<sShipName> forgot his logbook in the port administration. I need to catch up with the absent-minded Captain @<sCapName>, and return him his logbook.
According to the chief of port, @<sCapName2> has made way for @<sTargetCity> @<sAreal>.
#TEXT  2
I met the sea bungler en route to @<sTargetCity>. The task of the chief of port of @<sCity> is done.

I have found our intrepid captain in @<sCity>, in the house of the chief of port. The task of the chief of port of @<sCity2> is done.

Kill the Beggars
#TEXT  1
A rather strange gentleman, a certain Oliver Trust, presented me an even strange mission. He wants me to kill all the beggars in the Caribbean.
Well, as they say, beggars can't be choosers. Though the task may be lunacy, the reward is grand - one million piasters! They will be held in deposit by a moneylender in @<sCity>. When I asked, my client simply growled about civil decadence. I find it hard to understand that view, as in my experience beggars are quite harmless. Frankly, this business seems to have little to do with morals.
#TEXT  2
The task is finished. Unless I miss my count, there should be naught a beggar left in the entire Caribbean. Never again shall a nobleman be accosted in the street. Unless you count my badgering that moneylender for my deposit. Which should be next on my list.
#TEXT  3
I asked a beggar why someone would have so much wrath for his kind; he replied that I need to talk to a particular tramp in @<sCity>, chap by the name of @<sName>. He has something to say that may interest me greatly.
#TEXT  4
I talked to the bum in question. He believes that Director-General Peter Stuyvesant is involved in the extermination order. I need to somehow infiltrate his residence in Willemstad, and find some more substantive clues.
#TEXT  5
I found a locked chest in Stuyvesant's office. I suppose I may find what I need in there.
#TEXT  6
I struck a deal with the manufacturer of the Director-General's chest. This craftsman calls himself "The Keymaster", though his real, if unlikely, name is Hill Corner. He lives in a house not far from the stairway leading toward the church.
Two days from now, the key to Stuyvesant's chest will be ready for me.
#TEXT  7
@<sName> told me something rather interesting. It appears that the missing tramp Teaser Dan was telling stories about Justice Island, even claiming that he visited it! And apparently that's exactly the island mentioned in the correspondence of the Dutch West-Indian Company.
So I guess I should investigate the disappearance of this Teaser Dan. To do so I need to go to Willemstad - that is, to the place where Dan was last seen. Somehow, I will wrest an explanation from the key parties in this tale.
#TEXT  8
The owner of the tavern in Willemstad has thoroughly described Teaser Dan to me. He's a jolly tramp, quite to my liking! Still, I learned nothing new of his disappearance.
Instead, the tavern owner warned me that I should keep out of Stuyvesant's and the Dutch West-Indian Company's business. He says it's not a wise thing to meddle in. Pshaw! Am I not a pirate? 
#TEXT  9
Today I visited Curacao's Director-General Stuyvesant. As soon as I mentioned Teaser, Stuyvesant demanded, in the most intimidating manner, to know why I was looking for him. I had to quickly fib my way out of the discussion.
In the end, my conversation with Peter Stuyvesant gave me absolutely nothing. The only thing I can do now is to find some representatives of the Dutch West-Indian Company here in the Caribbean. And the big question is, how exactly am I supposed to do that?
I need to think about anyone even remotely connected with these businessmen. Excluding Stuyvesant, of course...
#TEXT  10
I found a thread to the Dutch West-Indian Company through the agents of nations. I discerned where they get their licenses!
I have also learned something concerning the identity of the company's representative in the Caribbean sea. It's none other than my new acquaintance Oliver Trust, he of the beggar fury. Now I need to head toward the island of San Martin, and the city of Marigo.
#TEXT  11
I have got to the truth in the mystery surrounding this beggar nonsense - though in so doing I had to sweat a lot, and ultimately kill the client himself - Oliver Trust. I learned a lot from an unfinished letter addressed to his seniors.
It seems that Teaser Dan stumbled upon some dodgy island, and the Dutch West Indian Company confirmed this. Teaser was eliminated, but the rumors began to spread amongst the beggars, who were all desperately hoping for better times. To stop the circulation of rumors regarding this Island, a decision was made to simply eliminate all the tramps. It's fortunate that Trust decided upon me as his functionary!
The company correspondence mentions luxury goods and valuables on the Island. I suppose this means I should visit it, since now I know its approximate location. If I am to believe Oliver Trust's conclusions, the Island is to the northwest, north of cape Catoche and west of Havana.
Well then! New adventures and infinite treasures await me! Forward, into to the weird and unknown!
First, however, I should visit my tramp friend, @<sName>. I think he should hear this tale out, to its very end.
#TEXT  12

#QUEST ISS_MainLine
In the City of Abandoned Ships
#TEXT  1
Well, here I also have landed on Justice Island, for which so many have searched so long. Actually, here it is known as the City of Abandoned Ships, a fitting appellation after all that has been lost here, ships and men alike.
As soon as I set foot on one of the ships, I immediately met a local resident, George Stokes. He brought me up to speed a little bit. Now I must find a shelter 'til the end of the storm, then meet the local leader - a certain Admiral Chad Capper. It's either that or he finds me, which apparently I don't want.
#TEXT  2
George Stokes told me that this "Diffindur", that Teaser Dan mentioned in connection with his key, is, most probably, the Fernando Diffindur, a battered flute on the other end of the island. That ship can't even be reached overland.
#TEXT  3
I had a meeting with Admiral Chad Capper. It seems that Chad is the very same Capper who, about three years ago, set sail after this prize and disappeared without trace. Now he's here, and he's in charge of the whole city! Not bad...
Bad, is something else - I have been completely fleeced. Now I'm flat broke, and I need to start again from scratch. I have become a mere citizen of the City. Sure, it may sound impressive...
#TEXT  4
Incidentally, I asked Hill Brunner, owner of the tavern, about Teaser Dan. The response I got gave me a bit of a jolt. Seems that everyone thinks that Teaser drowned! In any case, Hill advised me not to flap my gums about Teaser, and especially not the fact that he reached Mainland.
It's all to do with the Admiral, who strictly enforces the city law that no one may build ships or rafts to leave this place. As a matter of fact, it's nothing less than a ban on leaving the city!
Of course, you could call this city Justice Island, as the rules here are basically democratic. However, there are a lot of things I don't like about this place.
Anyway, I'll talk to the tavern owner about Teaser Dan a little bit later; he needs some time to ponder the news. For now, I should thoroughly examine my new home, and get acquainted with everyone...
#TEXT  5
The tavern owner, Hill Brunner, agreed to meet me after midnight in his so-called cellar. It's one of the cabins on this same vessel, and to get there I need to go above deck and continue to the stern of the ship.
#TEXT  6
Hill Brunner sent me to the flute Fernando Diffindur, which Teaser Dan often frequented when he was here. According to the tavern owner, it is there that I may find some proof for my words.
#TEXT  7
I need to find a certain Andre Labore, the city carpenter. Hill Brunner thinks that he was the one who helped Teaser Dan in constructing the vessel that he must have used to reach the mainland.
#TEXT  8
I found the carpenter, Andre Labore, and cautiously spoke with him. Andre agreed to meet me in a cabin aboard the corvette Protector.
#TEXT  9
That scumbag Andre Labore brought a militiaman with him! I'm forced to take up arms. Curses!
#TEXT  10
The owner of the tavern, Hill Brunner, thinks that I should cover my tracks, so to speak. I'll need to go to the galleon Velasco, the base of the Narwhal clan. There, in a bow cabin that serves as a storeroom for the clan, I need to wait for one of the narwhals and kill him. Then I should remove the Narwhal clan amulet from his corpse and bring it to Admiral Chad Capper.
This all should throw a nice big red herring in the Admiral's face, and direct any suspicion regarding the militiaman and carpenter murders away from me.
#TEXT  11
I caught one narwhal in the clan storeroom. Now to proceed according to the established plan...
#TEXT  12
Chad Capper bought my ruse. He decided that now would be a good time to wipe out the Narwhal clan once and for all, and he entrusted this task to me. For reassurance, the Admiral gave me several militiamen, to assist for the duration of the mission; they will be waiting for me on the Velasco. Well then, to the Velasco I go!
#TEXT  13
So, the Admiral's mission is done; the Narwhal clan is no more. I can go back to the Admiral now.
#TEXT  14
For destroying the narwhals without losing any of my men, the Admiral rewarded me with one hundred thousand gold.
#TEXT  15
While storming the Protector, I lost some of my men. My reward for completing the job is ten thousand gold.
#TEXT  16
While storming the Protector, I lost all the militiamen that were accorded me. This upset Chad Capper tremendously; still, as a whole the operation was deemed successful.
#TEXT  17
I told the owner of the tavern about my adventures with the Narwhal clan. His reaction was slightly surprising to me...
So, Hill Brunner asked me to wait a few days and come visit him more often. He needs to find something out, apparently. Well then, I'll do as he asks.
#TEXT  18
Hill Brunner suggested that I eavesdrop on a conversation between the Admiral and a certain individual. This conversation should happen today at midnight, in the tavern. To hear it, I must hide in the tavern cellar, behind the column near the grating. I must be there at midnight.
#TEXT  19
I couldn't get to the tavern cellar 'til midnight. It seems I've lost my chance to overhear the Admiral's conversation.
#TEXT  20
I waited in the tavern cellar until the Admiral and another man arrived. Just as Hill Brunner told me, they were going to talk there exactly at midnight. However, I didn't hide well enough, and they saw me. The conversation was over before it even started. I didn't even learn who the Admiral was with.
#TEXT  21
Now Hill Brunner himself will do what I couldn't. I can only wait for the results.
#TEXT  22
Well that takes the cake! the Admiral's conversation with the Casper clan leader explained a lot. It appears that the Admiral has an arrangement with the Caspers, and like the bumbling idiot I can be, I cleared way for them by exterminating the Narwhals. And I thought it was I who tricked Chad Capper!
I must tell Hill Brunner about this conversation.
#TEXT  23
Hill Brunner will recollect who already lived in the city before he got here. We need this information to figure out who this mechanic is that the Admiral mentioned.
#TEXT  24
Hill Brunner, the tavern owner, is dead, and his place has been overtaken by Florence Slot, as designated by the Admiral himself. Well, that's a new twist in the tale...
#TEXT  25
Armo Duline, the waitress in the tavern, told me how she found Brunner's corpse in the cellar. Also, and this is an interesting part, she told me of the questions that Hill asked her shortly before his death. He asked Armo if she remembered the man who lived here before him. And he also asked about some mechanic.
Yes, things are rather bad; I've lost a very important ally. I'll ask the Admiral what is being done in connection with Hill's murder. And now I must find the person who lived in the city before Hill. It seems that by searching for him, Brunner paid with his life.
#TEXT  26

And he also asked about that same mechanic whom the Admiral mentioned in his conversation with the leader of the Caspers.
This business is getting serious. Someone was not happy that Hill was digging in this direction. And I have a pretty good idea who that was...
I'll have to ask the Admiral about any measures taken in connection with Hill's murder. I'll ask the Admiral what is being done in connection with Hill's murder. And now I must find the person who lived in the city before Hill; he might know something about this mysterious mechanic.

#TEXT  40
I reached Henrik Vedeker and... released him, as it were. A long exchange of views on various aspects of life in the City of Abandoned Ships has led me to the conclusion that I should leave this place for the continent, and fast. Thing is, the city could easily be destroyed by a strong hurricane, and no one here would stand a chance.
The mechanic will help me with this. The thing is, he already has a serviceable corvette, and Henrik is willing to... er, sell it to me. He's asked for one and a half million piasters, both for the ship and for the tools I need to dive underwater and carry out certain duties to release the corvette.
I didn't go into details as to just what I need to do underwater, as right now my main task is to find one and a half million piasters. Well, might as well get a move on...
I still need to inform Chad Capper about the situation with the destruction of the Casper clan. And I must do this very carefully!

I understand that some terrible creatures live at the bottom. On the other hand, Henrik also said that the seabed is riddled with valuables. Hmm...
#TEXT  43
I settled with the Admiral the issue of the extermination of the Casper clan. I won't be punished in any way, but I had to promise: no more murders!

All goods necessary for a successful voyage are now transfered to my corvette, the Dog of War.
Henrik has burdened me with yet another task, if a logical one - to recruit a full crew. So I must persuade at least fifteen people to leave this place. I don't think that it should be too difficult, as many are willing to leave the City.
Our situation is complicated in that, an immense storm appears to be bearing in, which will soon obliterate the City. So... perhaps we should hurry, then.
#TEXT  60
I tried to speak with Chad Capper about the danger looming over the city. This is useless, of course; I got nothing from him apart from another pile of threats. Nevertheless, I must continue my recruitment drive...
#TEXT  61
The militiaman John Workman has agreed to join my crew. He suggested, however, that he should remain in the Admiral's residence for now, in case of emergency. He said that Chad Capper was thinking of getting rid of me.
#TEXT  62
@<sName> has agreed to join my crew. I still need to recruit @<iCrew> people to reach the minimum necessary crewmembers.
#TEXT  63
I have finished recruiting my crew. The fifteen people I needed for the journey were sent to San Gabriel. I imagine that Vedeker has already finished bringing people to the corvette.
Now it's my turn to get to my ship as quickly as possible, such that we can be out of the city before the storm hits us with full force. Forward, to the San Gabriel - it's time to leave this place!
#TEXT  64
Dammit, Capper arrested Vedeker!
Will my headaches never cease? Now I've no chance of slipping away quietly. Now I've got to go in and rescue the fool mechanic. And fast, before the hurricane obliterates the City. Yes, a pirate's life for me. What was I thinking?!
#TEXT  65
In the residence, the Admiral attacked me without much conversation. I defeated him, with the help of John Workman; he kept his word, and aided me in my hour of need. Unfortunately, John died during the fight.
Now I must quickly find Vedeker.
#TEXT  66
In the residence, the Admiral attacked me without much conversation. I defeated him, with the help of John Workman; he kept his word, and aided me in my hour of need.
John has agreed to join my crew as an officer, which greatly pleases me. Also, John told me that Vedeker was thrown in prison. So now I must quickly hoof it to the Tartarus, to release the mechanic.
#TEXT  67
I reached Vedeker, but was unable to release him. He's locked up, and I don't know where to find the key...
Meanwhile, the storm grows ever stronger. If I don't leave immediately, then I most likely will not leave at all. Or even live at all. Henrik sent me to the second mast of the Fernando Diffindur, that same shattered ship where Teaser Dan hid his chest all that time ago. From there, I should reach my corvette without much more event.
Thar she blows, and away we go! Right now! It's time to bid my final farewell to the City of Abandoned Ships.
#TEXT  68
I won over one militiamen at least, in John Workman. If something happens, he promised to help me in the fight and act on my side.
#TEXT  69
At the height of the storm, I have successfully left the City of Abandoned Ships. I imagine that the city was quickly devoured by the raging abyss, assuming that Henrik Vedeker's scientific projections were all in line. This magnificent corvette, the Dog of War, which bought from the mechanic for one and a half million, really does seem an excellent sailing ship - ideal for a corsair.
After all my experiences in the City, I am overwhelmed by ambivalence... Sure, I'm happy to be free again, but... what a unique place. Never the like shall I see again...
#TEXT  70
The jailer Thomas Boyle has agreed to join me as I storm the San Gabriel. In his place I would have done the same. They killed his girl, after all - the sweet Armo.

I finished the task of Padre Angel. Now the parish is stocked up with candles for many church services to come.

Life on Esmeralda
#TEXT  1
Pedro Hurtado, a citizen of the City, has suggested that I visit the living quarters of the galleon Esmeralda. I must do this during the day, whilst the shop owner Eric Jost is busy in the shop itself. I understand that I will meet some guards in there. The money I gather will be split equally between Pedro and me.
#TEXT  2
I met Pedro in the agreed place. He easily unlocked the door into the shop's storeroom. Now all on me...
#TEXT  3
The deed is done. The room is cleared; the guards are dead. However, I didn't find any money there. Looks like Pedro was mistaken. Too bad...
#TEXT  4
The deed is done. The room is cleared; the guards are dead; we've split the takings down the middle. Case closed.


#QUEST ISS_ElisHusband
The Marital Dallies of Poor Alice Taylor
#TEXT  1
I heard rumor that that Alice Taylor's husband, a known brawler and drunkard, was thrown into prison. Now Alice is looking for help to release her worse half.
#TEXT  2
Maxim Taylor, who is in prison, has asked me to inform his wife, Alice Taylor, that he was put behind the bars again.
#TEXT  3
The chief of prison, Gabriel d'Exmes, has informed me that Maxim Taylor was thrown in prison for improper behavior toward the Admiral himself! Now that's something...
#TEXT  4
To learn what will happen to Maxim Taylor, I need to speak to Chad Capper. Or so the chief of prison tells me.
#TEXT  5
I have promised Alice Taylor to release her husband from prison.
#TEXT  6
Maxim Taylor told me that during that ill-fated day he went to the tavern and got drunk as a swine. After that, it's all a blur. Hmm.
#TEXT  7
Oh my, Maxim Taylor really is in some deep trouble. It seems that after a long drinking binge he paid admiral a visit and put a knife to his throat! I suppose Taylor should just be happy that he's still alive, after hijinks like that.
It seems that he has no control over himself when he's drunk.
#TEXT  8
A waitress in the tavern told me that the day when Taylor went to the Admiral, he didn't leave the tavern alone, but with Gilles Baru. It seems to me that this Gilles Baru fellow may throw some light on how Taylor appeared at the Admiral's place.
#TEXT  9
Aha. So it was Gilles Baru who directed the piss-faced Taylor to the Admiral, to settle their scores. I need to tell Capper about this. Perhaps he will excuse Maxim...
#TEXT  10
Once the Admiral learned of Gilles Baru's part in Taylor's escapade, he agreed to give Maxim one more chance to hold on the right path. Now I must visit Alice, to tell her the news and receive my reward.


#QUEST LSC_findDekster
Layton Dexter: Have You Seen This Pirate?
#TEXT  1
Rumor has it that Lea Toors mentioned a certain Layton Dexter. I wonder who this Dexter is?
#TEXT  2
Rojel Haag told me of a certain pirate by the name of Layton Dexter. It is said that he stood up against Chad Capper, after which he disappeared.
That's all I know. Rojel told me that if I wish to learn more, I should speak with Lea Toors.
#TEXT  3
Lea Toors told me a very entertaining story. It seems that Chad Capper and Layton Dexter were once good friends, until some financial disagreements crawled in between them. And then Chad probably killed Layton, on the battleship Tartarus.
#TEXT  4
It seems that the jailer on Tartarus, Thomas Boyle, is a little overanxious. He told me that Layton Dexter is behind the prison doors of Tartarus!
#TEXT  5
The Admiral told me that Layton Dexter was punished, and now he is protecting his money - which, apparently, he tried to steal.
#TEXT  6
Ho-ho! It seems I have found Layton Dexter. And he really is protecting Chad Capper's money. The Admiral seems to have an unusual sense of humor.
Well, I sure wouldn't mind finding a key to this chest! I don't think that Layton would mind if I were to sift through it's contents... Hee hee...
#TEXT  7
Blistering barnacles! I see that Thomas Boyle wasn't lying. Layton Dexter really is behind that door! And it seems to me that the chest next to Layton is the reason for discord between the Admiral and Dexter. I sure wouldn't mind having a key for that thing...
#TEXT  8
I found a human skeleton next to a locked chest on the Tartarus. Looks like he could have done with a key as well... 
#TEXT  9
I found a human skeleton next to a locked chest on the Tartarus. This skeleton is probably what's left of the unfortunate Layton Dexter. And the chest, I believe, is the reason for discord between Capper and Dexter. I sure wouldn't mind having a key for that thing...
#TEXT  10
Rumor has it that the Admiral lost a key that holds some very strong importance to him, and now he's searching for it all over the city. It very well may be the lost key that opens the chest next to the skeleton!
I must find the lost key before the Admiral does.
#TEXT  11
The Admiral found his key before I did. A pity. I guess now I won't ever learn what treasures lie inside that chest...
#TEXT  12
I found the key that the Admiral lost. Now I can check my guess as to where this key might apply...


#QUEST TakeVineToPrisoner
The Task of Dominic Legro
#TEXT  1
Dominic Legro has asked me to find a bottle of wine somewhere and deliver it to his friend, Thomas Boyle, who is the jailer on battleship Tartarus.
#TEXT  2
Okay... So I gave Thomas Boyle a bottle of wine. A few swigs later, he asked me to tell Dominic Legro that he will cut his ears off, and perhaps he'll do it on the move. Now that's a request you don't get every day...
I must find Dominic, and tell him that Boyle is unhappy with him.
#TEXT  3
Dominic asked me to go back to Boyle and find why he is so displeased. Legro swears that he doesn't understand what's happening.
#TEXT  4
Apparently, Boyle is unhappy about Dominic Legro's flirtation with the waitress at the tavern, Armo Duline.
#TEXT  5
Dominic Legro assured me that he was only talking with Armo. I need to convince Boyle that it was really no more than that.
#TEXT  6
It seems that I have reconciled the two friends. Now I must tell Dominic about my successful negotiations with Thomas.
#TEXT  7
As a reward for participating in the affairs of these two friends, Dominic Legro gave me a simple chest key.


#QUEST SeekDoubleMushket
The Double-Barreled Musket
#TEXT  1
Humphrey Douglas, a resigned English musketeer, has asked me to find his lost double-barreled musket. The weapon was taken away from Humphrey during the pirate attack. No one know the pirates were, but Humphrey heard his ship's crew shouting about some kind of an arrow. I'll need to ask a pirate about this.
If I find this musket, Humphrey will join my crew as an officer.
#TEXT  2
Apparently, Humphrey's ship was attacked by a very unusual corsair, the Albert Zivert. He doesn't belong to the Brotherhood of the Coast, so I won't find him through the pirates. Jackman said that this "Zivert" is always out in the sea, and plies between various island bays.
Jackman recommended that I carefully measure all passing ships. I need to find the brigantine Arrow.
#TEXT  3
I found the musket and handed it over to Humphrey Douglas. Now Humphrey is my very own officer, which is quite nice.
#TEXT  10
The brigantine I was looking for is gone. So much for that double-barreled musket.


#QUEST CapBloodLine_q1
The Doctor
#TEXT  1
I must immediately make for the Governor's estate, and see if I can somehow help Mrs. Steed.
#TEXT  2
Governor Steed told me that his wife was suffering from yet another migraine attack, and he despaired to calm her. I think I should examine her. She is in a bedroom on the second floor, to the right.
#TEXT  3
I must urgently go to the port and visit Mr. Dan, the apothecary. I remember him mentioning that his house was not far from the Governor's residence.
#TEXT  4
The Governor has allocated some money for purchasing the medicine. I was given @<iMoney> piasters.
#TEXT  5
The governor has doled me the sum of 2500 piasters, such that I might purchase medicine for his wife, but he demanded that I report my expenditure on my return...
#TEXT  6
As Mr. Dan was not at home, I had to find the medicine on my own. Now I must hurry back to the estate...
#TEXT  7
Everything is all right; I helped the governor's wife. Since it is already late, and the gates to that accursed Bishop's plantation are long closed, I was allowed to stay in the city and allocated a bedroom in the tavern. Oh, how good it is, even for one night, to feel like a man again, not a slave...

#QUEST CapBloodLine_q2
Whacker's Offer
#TEXT  1
I met Doctor Whacker at the apothecary's; he wished to discuss something with me, away from curious eyes and ears. Tomorrow I'll have to drop by the tavern, when I have the time.
#TEXT  2
So, the morning came. Now the Bishop will find me and probably send me off somewhere for the whole day. For instance, to put those innocent slaves on their feet; I imagine he woke them up last night and punished for some nonsense, simply because I didn't return before the gates were closed...
Still, I should inquire with Whacker as to his business with me. Mustn't waste time. God waits for no man.
#TEXT  3
I came to the tavern, but Whacker wasn't there. The Devil, I must find him...
#TEXT  4
It seems that I really am a considerable hindrance for the honorable Messrs. Whacker and Bronson, as the subject of our chilly dialog is the my potential escape from here. There are no doubts that Doctor Bronson knows all about this, and that Whacker is coordinating with him. Nevertheless, as they say, beggars can't be choosers. I should go find Jeremy Pitt.
#TEXT  5
Pitt is in. Now the task is to get enough people, prepare all that we need, and, tomorrow, go to Whacker and claim the money for a sloop. Only three slaves have some grasp of seafaring - Hagthorpe, Ogle, and Nicolas Dyke. I must speak to each of them.
#TEXT  6
Time to go back to the tavern and speak to Whacker. Not that there's anything left to speak about, but the money for the sloop would be nice. 
#TEXT  7
Doctor Whacker was only able to supply 18 000 piasters. I still need around 7000 more to purchase a sloop.
#TEXT  8
I collected the necessary sum, and sent Nettall for the sloop. Now I can only wait...


#QUEST WeaponsForEscape
Arms of Freedom
#TEXT  1
All should be done quietly, but some weapons will always be handy. Hardly anyone in the city will sell me weapons, and I simply can't risk stealing at such a crucial moment... I'll have to solve this problem some other way.
#TEXT  2
The innkeeper suggested that I speak to Mr. Griffin about weapons; he's the old armorer who lives not far from the Governor's estate.
#TEXT  3
The armorer, Griffin, has been boldly robbed: some Spanish bandit took his samples with the master's name engraved on the blades, then went to the house of Hells the fisherman. If he is caught or seen with the weapons of Mr. Griffin, both of them will be hanged at dawn. I must immediately seek the robber and disarm him, then return his stolen goods to their rightful owner. If I do this, Mr. Griffin will provide me with unmarked boarding sabers and pistols by today's nightfall, all for only @<iMoney> piasters.
#TEXT  4
Me and the armorer couldn't agree on terms. I won't say that I'm upset, since doing business with this old goat wouldn't do me any good. I will find another source for the weapons.
#TEXT  5
I had no choice - the fisherman just got in my way; it's not like I expecting him to stand there. Still, in a way I should be grateful to him; after all, he relieved me of the necessity of fighting the Spaniard. Hells had 2000 piasters on him, part of which certainly belonged to the bandit. Besides, I found a bundle with Griffin's samples on the Spaniard. It's high time to be back at the armorer.
#TEXT  6
In an hour, I should be at Mr. Griffin's place to receive my order.
#TEXT  7
In the street I met a person, probably Spanish. I don't know how he got here, but I have doubts about his intentions. He needed something from Mr. Griffin, the armorer.
#TEXT  8
More than ten minutes have already passed without news. Obviously, I have no other choice but to go back.
#TEXT  9
Mr. Griffin has given me all that I need, in gratitude for saving his life.
#TEXT  10
The trader from the market square, the one whose son I was lucky enough to rescue from a gruesome fate, gave me a bundle with all that that I might need in case of unforeseen circumstances. Fortune is on my side - it's incredibly difficult to acquire weapons in my kind of situation; I'd have said nigh on impossible. But I do have some remaining problems...
#TEXT  11
In the tavern I had the pleasure of speaking with a queer old smuggler. Queer in that, not only has he the weapons I need, in the quantity I'm after, but also in that all he asks in exchange is some ring from the Governor's house. How could he know what rings the Governor has lying around? And why is he so interested in it that he is ready to trade a slave a veritable armory in exchange for it? Well, all right; now my is in finding this ring.
#TEXT  12
I couldn't get to the Governor. Unless I've an invitation, the guards will refuse to let me in. And he won't extend me the courtesy so long as both he and his wife are well. Therefore, I need an outside pretext...
#TEXT  13
Thanks to Mr. Dan's naivety, I now have opportunity to enter the residence. Let's waste no more time, then...
#TEXT  14
To my bewilderment, that precise ring that the smuggler mentioned lays there for all to see, on the table surface. Mrs. Steed doesn't really wear it.
#TEXT  15
Fortunately, this business was limited to a small deceit, without the need to resort to stealing. Mrs. Steed willingly gave me the ring, which, as she said, was found beside her bed this morning.
The ring itself looks absolutely ordinary - golden, without any facets - yet is improbably heavy for the size and shape. 
How did the smuggler know of the ring? And why does he need it? But then, is it any of my business? I should just return to the tavern and ask for my reward.
#TEXT  16
The smuggler got his ring, and I got my money and armaments. That certainly was an interesting trinket, but I simply have no time to study it. Whatever it was, I've done my part and gotten what I need. Time to be on!

#QUEST HugtorpTrouble
Hagthorpe's Quandary
#TEXT  1
In Bridgetown there is a person by the name of Stewart Winterwood. For Hagthorpe to accompany me, all that he requires is the death of the Englishman who took his life and made him a slave. I don't know all the details, but looks like I have no choice - I must kill Winterwood. I can find him either in the tavern or in the brothel.
#TEXT  2
Hagthorpe didn't want to sail with me. His sworn enemy, Stewart Winterwood, resides in the city. At one point, this fellow disgraced the old seadog by taking all that he had: his family, his good name, his freedom. He had Hagthorpe put in shackles. But I persuaded him not to proceed with his mad revenge fantasies, and he agreed to sail with me, temporarily postponing the villain's execution.
Still, I should investigate this business that Whacker has for me. Mustn't waste time.
#TEXT  3
I challenged Winterwood for a duel, and slew him. I think that Stuart won't be needing the thousand piasters that he had on his person. I must return to Hagthorpe.
#TEXT  4
Having learned of the death of Winterwood, Hagthorpe has agreed to join me.

#QUEST DiekeQuest
Junior Officer Nicolas Dyke
#TEXT  1
At the most crucial moment, Colonel Bishop has decided to resell Nicolas Dyke, who was a junior officer in his time. Nicolas believes that it's too late to do anything about it, but... by all means, I should prevent this deal from transpiring.
#TEXT  2
The buyer is a certain Weston; I must quickly learn who and where he is.
#TEXT  3
Recently a Jamaican merchant arrived in the city with some cargo. He's an old friend of the Bishop's. It may stand to conjecture that he is that Weston. I'll need to find his house, then see where I might go from there.
#TEXT  4
It seems that Charlie Weston was going to get Dyke on the cheap side. He's got 6000 piasters and a curious-looking idol ready for Bishop. Perhaps I should keep all this stuff for myself; I'm sure I'll find a use for it. It's not like Bishop needs any of it, anyway...

#QUEST OglQuest
The One-Eyed Gunner
#TEXT  1
The only artillery gunner available to me took out a loan of five thousand piasters from the moneylender. I simply can't sail away without Ogle - the risk is too great. I must find the money, and pay the old man's debt.

I have repaid Ogle's debt. I should go let him know. 
#TEXT  3
Ogle is in.

#QUEST FishermanQuest

#TEXT  1
Fisherman Hells has given me some work: I need to learn the spot where Arnold Summerlite, a rival fisherman, has been catching all his fish. For this, Hells promised me 2000 piasters.
#TEXT  2
I uncovered Summerlite's secret fishing spot. Now I only need inform Hells, and claim my money.

#QUEST UsurerQuest
The Anonymous Debtor
#TEXT  1
The moneylender offered me three thousand piasters to find an impostor who took out a loan on behalf of Raphael Guinness, having taken advantage of his morning absent-mindedness. I don't even know where to begin. The innkeeper himself will ask at least a thousand for the information... Who else might help me?
#TEXT  2
I had to slip the innkeeper five hundred for the information on this Guinness fellow. He told me that somehow Raphael found enough money for a ship, and then went on to seal the deal. It seems that the innkeeper himself doesn't know him that well; he was under the impression that the impostor was the real Guinness. I'll have to drop by the shipyard.
#TEXT  3
I played the role well... Mom always said I should have been an actor. Why was it I joined the service, again? Anyway, the terrified impostor - his real name is Alex Winner - has given me all his savings. That's 55,000 piasters, a piece of which belongs to the moneylender... Perhaps.
#TEXT  4
Overwhelmed by my righteousness, Raphael/Alex returned me the loan money. Now I should return the money to the moneylender and receive my share. Or... should I? 

#QUEST PirateQuest
The Fallen Pirate
#TEXT  1
In the shop, I met a peculiar pirate by the name of Swallow - Jacques Swallow. Now, where have I heard that name before... Well, I'm sure 1500 piasters will make a good friend of anyone. That will be my recompense, should I find a captain to take Swallow to Tortuga for no more than 3000.
#TEXT  2
The shipbuilder mentioned a certain Captain Mayner, who just bought a corvette from him. Look at that, I didn't even have to mention Swallow's name. Now I only need find this happy new corvette owner.
#TEXT  3
Having learned the passenger's name, the shipbuilder told me the story of this pirate's fall. When he gave his first mate a treasure map, Swallow didn't even conceive that his crew might choose use it for tobacco paper. When they woke and sobered up, the pirates accused Jacques of everything under the sun, then left him on an island to die. When by some miracle he escaped, Jacques Swallow found himself in a sticky situation: not only did he need to find his ship, the Ebony Oyster, but also to punish its captain as an example. Well, I will wish him good luck, but for now I must speak with Captain John Mayner, who just bought a corvette on the shipyard and will soon be sailing away.
#TEXT  4
John Mayner, the captain of the Sailing Briton, has agreed to deliver Jacques Swallow to Tortuga for three thousand piasters. Now I need only find the pirate and tell him about it, then claim my reward.
#TEXT  5
I received my money from Swallow, though he obviously was in little hurry to part with it. What an odd bird...

#QUEST EscapeFormBarbados
Escape from Barbados
#TEXT  1
Our escape plan is on the verge of failure. Colonel Bishop tracked down Jeremy Pitt when as was undergoing the final preparations for our departure. I decided to free our navigator as soon as night falls. Incidentally, Jeremy hid some weapons in a chest amongst the planks at the edge of the plantation; they might come in handy. The others will make their way to the city, and will await us there, ensconced at the shipyard.
#TEXT  2
When I rescued Pitt from the Bishop's men, he informed me that Nettall had ran away with our sloop. I must immediately warn Hagthorpe, Dyke, Ogle, and the others before they all get caught.
#TEXT  3
Dumb chance has complicated our plans at the most crucial of moments. It was a big ship; looked like Spanish caper, under a a foreign flag. In planning their raid, they chose a moment when not a single warship remained in the bay. The ship's cunning actions remained absolutely unnoticed until, arousing no suspicion, she quietly slipped into the bay and saluted the fort at point-blank with a twenty-cannon broadside. By sunset, two hundred and fifty Spaniards had become the new owners of Bridgetown.
#TEXT  4
When we all reunited, we decided to capture the Spanish ship under cover of night.
#TEXT  5
We captured a fine Spanish vessel, the Cinco Liagas. Now we can finally leave Barbados and regain our freedom.


#QUEST Tenochtitlan
Tenochtitlan
#TEXT  1
In a bay they call the "Mosquito Coast", I met a Spaniard named Silvio Ricci. Crying like a vulture, he advised that I keep away from this place, the further the better. From his confusing story, I gathered that a certain Don Esteban organized an expedition to some Indian city that Cortes himself once conquered, about 150 years ago! The expedition met a horrible doom, Señor Ricci being the only survivor.
#TEXT  2
I met an Aztec named Montezuma, on the coast near Tenochtitlan. After a long conversation, Montezuma proposed me a deal - to bring him the jade skull of Mictlantecuhtli, god of the dead.
First of all, I need to remove a curse of fire from a dam that links Tenochtitlan with the coast. Montezuma tells me there are two ways of doing this.
1. Find a totem of Camaxtli; enter the city through the fire, and insert this Totem into the sacrificial stone.
2. Find two totems - one of the goddess Tlazolteotl, devourer of filth; one of the god of sky and sun, Tonatiuh. Then insert them into sacrificial stones on the shore before the dam.
Montezuma is a very odd Indian. He's not telling me all that he might. Even now, he seems to know where these totems are. But he won't say, exactly; he prefers to give me cryptic hints.
Still, he did give me an idea where to start looking. I remember it all verbatim:
The totem of Camaxtli is nearer than you think. The totem of Tlazolteotl lurks close, in the grass. The totem of Tonatiuh was thrown to the jungle twixt two Spanish cities, at an isthmus between the great lands.
#TEXT  3
I removed the curse of fire. Now is when the fun really begins...
Now I should find ten totems of Aztec gods, to place in the ten sacrificial stones in all these temples. The temples are in small pyramids, on each side of the big pyramid, formally known as the Temple of Great Life Force.
This time Montezuma hasn't even deigned to provide me hints regarding the ten totems. Lord, I'll need to search the whole world...
Just marvelous.
#TEXT  4
Phew, that was a hard day's work. No sooner did I slash through an army of revived Aztecs than I was forced to fight none other than the Aztec god of the kingdom of the dead, in person no less. Still, I proved to him the skill of a good corsair.
I was allowed to go where I please, and I retained the jade skull as a bonus to my freedom. Beautiful!
Incidentally, Mictlantecuhtli told me that my pal Montezuma is none other than the spirit of Montezuma II, the last leader of Aztecs. This Montezuma is cursed by the gods, which is why he can't travel to the kingdom of the dead and is domed to ramble eternally along the coast of lake Texcoco, around Tenochtitlan.
Mictlantecuhtli added that the jade skull will help me, somehow. Well, that's nice.
#TEXT  5
Montezuma II demanded that I hand him the jade skull. I refused to give it over, as frankly I'm a bit ambivalent toward the prospect of a restored Aztec Empire. It's nothing personal, understand...
#TEXT  6
The presence of the jade skull helped me to send Montezuma to the kingdom of the dead. Hey, Mictlantecuhtli was true to his word. The skull really did help me.
#TEXT  7
All ten of Aztec totems having been activated, I opened the Temple of Great Life Force.

In Caracas, the crowd unleashed mob justice on some unfortunate person from Maracaibo. Before his death, he tell me about some curse that had apparently struck the whole city. I'd better learn what's happening over there.
#TEXT  2
I went to Maracaibo, but it seems that everything is all right there. During our conversation, the innkeeper mentioned the small fishing town of Des Moines, near Maracaibo. Queer thing was, the fishermen therefrom hadn't visited the tavern for quite a while...
#TEXT  3
What surprise, that I had to fight my way into this godforsaken town!
#TEXT  4
In all my life I haven't seen such horror! A whole city of skeletons. My belly turns at the sight... My business is in ships, the sea, the wind... It's not even the skeletons; I wouldn't mind them so much, but these nightmarish mutations... No, I prefer not to mess with the netherworld.
Still, it would be useful to visit the Holy Inquisition...
#TEXT  5
I discovered a horrible secret in Des Moines. the city is afflicted by a terrible curse - at night, its inhabitants turn into skeletons! The most interesting bit is that the inhabitants have no idea why was this misfortune has been laid on their polished skulls.
In my pity for the inhabitants of Des Moines, I agreed to help them. The city chief, Fernando Torres, recommended that I find a certain young English lady, an Elizabeth Sheppard. She visited Des Moines not too long ago, was asking about pirates, a skipper, and a brig called the Queen. It was right after a corsairs' dispute amongst the Queen's crew, at the Cape of Unfulfilled Hope, that this bedlam began.
#TEXT  6
I found Elizabeth Sheppard. She appears to be the daughter of Captain Stayton, once a famous filibuster in his own right.
Torres was right; this young lady is a remarkable woman. She said that the captain of that same brig, the Queen, has come to her house at night, and she only shrieked a little. If I were awakened at night by such a face, I would make far more noise than that. 
In short, Ms. Sheppard and I have the same goals. She learned what could remove the curse - a jade skull of the Aztec god of the dead. Now I need to recover it from Tenochtitlan, the lost capital of the Aztecs.

Elizabeth Sheppard sent me to search for the brig they call the Queen. I have absolutely no idea where this brig might be sailing. I guess I'll just need to keep my eye out, during my sea voyages.
When I find the brig, I need to deliver the jade skull to the captain's cabin. I strongly doubt that it can be done peaceably...

I overtook the Queen, boarded her and remove the curse. The captain of the brig appears to be the elder sister of Elizabeth. And incidentally, she agreed to serve me as an officer. Well, yo-ho!

The curse has also been lifted from Des Moines, so all is back to normal.

The brig I was looking for is gone. Now I fear I shan't ever remove that Aztec curse...
